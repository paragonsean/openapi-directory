## commitImageStoreUploadSession

> commitImageStoreUploadSession(apiVersion, sessionId, opts)

Commit an image store upload session.

When all file chunks have been uploaded, the upload session needs to be committed explicitly to complete the upload. Image store preserves the upload session until the expiration time, which is 30 minutes after the last chunk received. 

### Example

```javascript
import ServiceFabricClientApis from 'service_fabric_client_apis';

let apiInstance = new ServiceFabricClientApis.ImageStoreApi();
let apiVersion = "'6.0'"; // String | The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
let sessionId = "sessionId_example"; // String | A GUID generated by the user for a file uploading. It identifies an image store upload session which keeps track of all file chunks until it is committed.
let opts = {
  'timeout': 60 // Number | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
};
apiInstance.commitImageStoreUploadSession(apiVersion, sessionId, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully.');
  }
});
```

## uploadFile

> uploadFile(apiVersion, contentPath, opts)

Uploads contents of the file to the image store.

Uploads contents of the file to the image store. Use this API if the file is small enough to upload again if the connection fails. The file&#39;s data needs to be added to the request body. The contents will be uploaded to the specified path. Image store service uses a mark file to indicate the availability of the folder. The mark file is an empty file named \&quot;_.dir\&quot;. The mark file is generated by the image store service when all files in a folder are uploaded. When using File-by-File approach to upload application package in REST, the image store service isn&#39;t aware of the file hierarchy of the application package; you need to create a mark file per folder and upload it last, to let the image store service know that the folder is complete.

### Example

```javascript
import ServiceFabricClientApis from 'service_fabric_client_apis';

let apiInstance = new ServiceFabricClientApis.ImageStoreApi();
let apiVersion = "'6.0'"; // String | The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.

let contentPath = "contentPath_example"; // String | Relative path to file or folder in the image store from its root.
let opts = {
  'timeout': 60 // Number | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
};
apiInstance.uploadFile(apiVersion, contentPath, opts, (error, data, response) => {

    console.error(error);

## uploadFileChunk

> uploadFileChunk(apiVersion, contentPath, sessionId, contentRange, opts)

Uploads a file chunk to the image store relative path.

Uploads a file chunk to the image store with the specified upload session ID and image store relative path. This API allows user to resume the file upload operation. user doesn&#39;t have to restart the file upload from scratch whenever there is a network interruption. Use this option if the file size is large.  To perform a resumable file upload, user need to break the file into multiple chunks and upload these chunks to the image store one-by-one. Chunks don&#39;t have to be uploaded in order. If the file represented by the image store relative path already exists, it will be overwritten when the upload session commits.

### Example

```javascript
import ServiceFabricClientApis from 'service_fabric_client_apis';

let apiInstance = new ServiceFabricClientApis.ImageStoreApi();
let apiVersion = "'6.0'"; // String | The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.

However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
let contentPath = "contentPath_example"; // String | Relative path to file or folder in the image store from its root.
let sessionId = "sessionId_example"; // String | A GUID generated by the user for a file uploading. It identifies an image store upload session which keeps track of all file chunks until it is committed.
let contentRange = "contentRange_example"; // String | When uploading file chunks to the image store, the Content-Range header field need to be configured and sent with a request. The format should looks like \"bytes {First-Byte-Position}-{Last-Byte-Position}/{File-Length}\". For example, Content-Range:bytes 300-5000/20000 indicates that user is sending bytes 300 through 5,000 and the total file length is 20,000 bytes.
let opts = {
  'timeout': 60 // Number | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
};
apiInstance.uploadFileChunk(apiVersion, contentPath, sessionId, contentRange, opts, (error, data, response) => {
