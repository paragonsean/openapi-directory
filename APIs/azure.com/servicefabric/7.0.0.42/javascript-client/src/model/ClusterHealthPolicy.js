/**
 * Defines a map with max percentage unhealthy applications for specific application types. Each entry specifies as key the application type name and as value an integer that represents the MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications percentage used to evaluate the applications of the specified application type.  The application type health policy map can be used during cluster health evaluation to describe special application types. The application types included in the map are evaluated against the percentage specified in the map, and not with the global MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications defined in the cluster health policy. The applications of application types specified in the map are not counted against the global pool of applications. For example, if some applications of a type are critical, the cluster administrator can add an entry to the map for that application type and assign it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures). All other applications can be evaluated with MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications set to 20% to tolerate some failures out of the thousands of application instances. The application type health policy map is used only if the cluster manifest enables application type health evaluation using the configuration entry for HealthManager/EnableApplicationTypeHealthEvaluation.
