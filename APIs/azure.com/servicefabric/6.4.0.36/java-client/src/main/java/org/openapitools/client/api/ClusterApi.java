The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise &#39;OR&#39; operator.

The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values, obtained using the bitwise &#39;OR&#39; operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.  - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState.

Similarly, use NodesHealthStateFilter and ApplicationsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of nodes and applications returned based on their aggregated health state. Use ClusterHealthPolicies to override the health policies used to evaluate the health.
     * @param apiVersion The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be &#39;6.0&#39;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. (required)

The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states. Only nodes that match the filter are returned. All nodes are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise &#39;OR&#39; operator. For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of nodes with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.  - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero. - None - Filter that doesn&#39;t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1. - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2. - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4. - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8. - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535. (optional, default to 0)
     * @param applicationsHealthStateFilter Allows filtering of the application health state objects returned in the result of cluster health query based on their health state. The possible values for this parameter include integer value obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of HealthStateFilter enumeration. Only applications that match the filter are returned. All applications are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise &#39;OR&#39; operator. For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of applications with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.  - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState.

(optional, default to 0)

The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states. Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values, obtained using the bitwise &#39;OR&#39; operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.  - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState.

(optional, default to 0)
     * @param excludeHealthStatistics Indicates whether the health statistics should be returned as part of the query result. False by default. The statistics show the number of children entities in health state Ok, Warning, and Error. (optional, default to false)
     * @param includeSystemApplicationHealthStatistics Indicates whether the health statistics should include the fabric:/System application health statistics. False by default. If IncludeSystemApplicationHealthStatistics is set to true, the health statistics include the entities that belong to the fabric:/System application. Otherwise, the query result includes health statistics only for user applications. The health statistics must be included in the query result for this parameter to be applied. (optional, default to false)
     * @param timeout The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. (optional, default to 60)
     * @param clusterHealthPolicies Describes the health policies used to evaluate the cluster health. If not present, the health evaluation uses the cluster health policy defined in the cluster manifest or the default cluster health policy.

     * @param immediate A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn&#39;t reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately. (optional, default to false)
     * @param timeout The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. (optional, default to 60)
     * @param _callback The callback to be executed when the API call finishes
     * @return The request call
     * @throws ApiException If fail to process the API call, e.g. serializing the request body object
