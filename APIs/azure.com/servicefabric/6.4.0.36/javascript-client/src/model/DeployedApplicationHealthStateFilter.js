/**
 * Defines a list of filters that specify which deployed service packages to be included in the returned cluster health chunk as children of the parent deployed application.

All the deployed service packages are used to evaluate the parent deployed application aggregated health state, regardless of the input filters. The deployed application filter may specify multiple deployed service package filters. For example, it can specify a filter to return all deployed service packages with health state Error and another filter to always include a deployed service package on a node.

/**
 * The filter for the health state of the deployed applications. It allows selecting deployed applications if they match the desired health states. The possible values are integer value of one of the following health states. Only deployed applications that match the filter are returned. All deployed applications are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state. If not specified, default value is None, unless the node name is specified. If the filter has default value and node name is specified, the matching deployed application is returned. The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches deployed applications with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).  - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero. - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1. - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2. - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4. - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8. - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.
