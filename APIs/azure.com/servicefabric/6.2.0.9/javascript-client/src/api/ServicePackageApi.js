     * @param {String} nodeName The name of the node.
     * @param {String} applicationId The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \"~\" character. For example, if the application name is \"fabric:/myapp/app1\", the application identity would be \"myapp~app1\" in 6.0+ and \"myapp/app1\" in previous versions.
     * @param {String} servicePackageName The name of the service package.
     * @param {module:model/HealthInformation} healthInformation Describes the health information for the health report. This information needs to be present in all of the health reports sent to the health manager.
     * @param {Object} opts Optional parameters
     * @param {Boolean} [immediate = false)] A flag which indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately.
     * @param {Number} [timeout = 60)] The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
     * @param {module:api/ServicePackageApi~reportDeployedServicePackageHealthCallback} callback The callback function, accepting three arguments: error, data, response
