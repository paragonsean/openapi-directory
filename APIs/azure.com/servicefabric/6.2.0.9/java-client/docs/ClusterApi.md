# **getAadMetadata**
> AadMetadataObject getAadMetadata(apiVersion, timeout)

Gets the Azure Active Directory metadata used for secured connection to cluster.

Gets the Azure Active Directory metadata used for secured connection to cluster. This API is not supposed to be called separately. It provides information needed to set up an Azure Active Directory secured connection with a Service Fabric cluster.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.models.*;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("http://azure.local:19080");

    ClusterApi apiInstance = new ClusterApi(defaultClient);
    String apiVersion = "6.0"; // String | The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
    Long timeout = 60L; // Long | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
    try {
      AadMetadataObject result = apiInstance.getAadMetadata(apiVersion, timeout);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling ClusterApi#getAadMetadata");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());

# **getClusterHealthChunkUsingPolicyAndAdvancedFilters**
> ClusterHealthChunk getClusterHealthChunkUsingPolicyAndAdvancedFilters(apiVersion, timeout, clusterHealthChunkQueryDescription)

Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster using health chunks.

Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster using health chunks. The health evaluation is done based on the input cluster health chunk query description. The query description allows users to specify health policies for evaluating the cluster and its children. Users can specify very flexible filters to select which cluster entities to return. The selection can be done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy. The query can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name, and for this application, return only services that are in Error or Warning, and all partitions and replicas for one of these services.

By default, each application is evaluated using its specific application health policy, defined in the application manifest, or the default health policy, if no policy is defined in manifest.

Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster using the specified policy.

Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster. Use EventsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of health events reported on the cluster based on the health state.

# **getClusterManifest**
> ClusterManifest getClusterManifest(apiVersion, timeout)

Get the Service Fabric cluster manifest.

Get the Service Fabric cluster manifest. The cluster manifest contains properties of the cluster that include different node types on the cluster, security configurations, fault and upgrade domain topologies, etc.  These properties are specified as part of the ClusterConfig.JSON file while deploying a stand alone cluster. However, most of the information in the cluster manifest is generated internally by service fabric during cluster deployment in other deployment scenarios (e.g. when using azure portal).  The contents of the cluster manifest are for informational purposes only and users are not expected to take a dependency on the format of the file contents or its interpretation.

<a id="reportClusterHealth"></a>
# **reportClusterHealth**
> reportClusterHealth(apiVersion, healthInformation, immediate, timeout)

Sends a health report on the Service Fabric cluster.

Sends a health report on a Service Fabric cluster. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway node, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, run GetClusterHealth and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.models.*;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("http://azure.local:19080");

    ClusterApi apiInstance = new ClusterApi(defaultClient);
    String apiVersion = "6.0"; // String | The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
    HealthInformation healthInformation = new HealthInformation(); // HealthInformation | Describes the health information for the health report. This information needs to be present in all of the health reports sent to the health manager.
    Boolean immediate = false; // Boolean | A flag which indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately.
    Long timeout = 60L; // Long | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
    try {
