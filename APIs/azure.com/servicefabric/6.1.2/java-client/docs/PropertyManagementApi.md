    String apiVersion = "6.0"; // String | The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be \"6.0\".  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. 
    NameDescription nameDescription = new NameDescription(); // NameDescription | Describes the Service Fabric name to be created.
    Long timeout = 60L; // Long | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
    try {

| **apiVersion** | **String**| The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be \&quot;6.0\&quot;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.  | [default to 6.0] [enum: 6.0] |
| **nameId** | **String**| The Service Fabric name, without the &#39;fabric:&#39; URI scheme. | |
| **recursive** | **Boolean**| Allows specifying that the search performed should be recursive. | [optional] [default to false] |
