 * The filter for the health state of the partitions. It allows selecting partitions if they match the desired health states. The possible values are integer value of one of the following health states. Only partitions that match the filter are returned. All partitions are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state. If not specified, default value is None, unless the partition id is specified. If the filter has default value and partition id is specified, the matching partition is returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches partitions with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).  - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero. - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1. - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2. - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4. - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8. - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.
