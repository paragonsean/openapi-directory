Filters ApplicationTypeName and ApplicationDefinitionKindFilter cannot be specified at the same time.

Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

The value is 65535. - ServiceFabricApplicationDescription - Filter that matches input with ApplicationDefinitionKind value ServiceFabricApplicationDescription. The value is 1. - Compose - Filter that matches input with ApplicationDefinitionKind value Compose. The value is 2. 
     * @param {String} [applicationTypeName] The application type name used to filter the applications to query for. This value should not contain the application type version.
     * @param {Boolean} [excludeApplicationParameters = false)] The flag that specifies whether application parameters will be excluded from the result.
     * @param {String} [continuationToken] The continuation token parameter is used to obtain next set of results. A continuation token with a non empty value is included in the response of the API when the results from the system do not fit in a single response. When this value is passed to the next API call, the API returns next set of results. If there are no further results then the continuation token does not contain a value. The value of this parameter should not be URL encoded.

     * Validates the supplied application upgrade parameters and starts upgrading the application if the parameters are valid.
     * @param {module:model/String} apiVersion The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be \"6.0\".  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. 
     * @param {String} applicationId The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \"~\" character. For example, if the application name is \"fabric:/myapp/app1\", the application identity would be \"myapp~app1\" in 6.0+ and \"myapp/app1\" in previous versions. 
     * @param {module:model/ApplicationUpgradeDescription} applicationUpgradeDescription Parameters for an application upgrade.
     * @param {Object} opts Optional parameters
     * @param {Number} [timeout = 60)] The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
     * @param {module:api/ApplicationApi~startApplicationUpgradeCallback} callback The callback function, accepting three arguments: error, data, response
