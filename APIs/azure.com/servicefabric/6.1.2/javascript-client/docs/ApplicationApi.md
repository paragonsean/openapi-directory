## createApplication

> createApplication(apiVersion, applicationDescription, opts)

Creates a Service Fabric application.

Creates a Service Fabric application using the specified description.

### Example

```javascript
import ServiceFabricClientApis from 'service_fabric_client_apis';

let apiInstance = new ServiceFabricClientApis.ApplicationApi();
let apiVersion = "'6.0'"; // String | The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be \"6.0\".  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. 
let applicationDescription = new ServiceFabricClientApis.ApplicationDescription(); // ApplicationDescription | Description for creating an application.
let opts = {
  'timeout': 60 // Number | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
};
apiInstance.createApplication(apiVersion, applicationDescription, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully.');
  }
});
```

## deleteApplication

> deleteApplication(apiVersion, applicationId, opts)

Deletes an existing Service Fabric application.

Deletes an existing Service Fabric application. An application must be created before it can be deleted. Deleting an application will delete all services that are part of that application. By default Service Fabric will try to close service replicas in a graceful manner and then delete the service. However if service is having issues closing the replica gracefully, the delete operation may take a long time or get stuck. Use the optional ForceRemove flag to skip the graceful close sequence and forcefully delete the application and all of the its services.

### Example

```javascript
import ServiceFabricClientApis from 'service_fabric_client_apis';

let apiInstance = new ServiceFabricClientApis.ApplicationApi();
let apiVersion = "'6.0'"; // String | The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be \"6.0\".

However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. 
let applicationId = "applicationId_example"; // String | The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \"~\" character. For example, if the application name is \"fabric:/myapp/app1\", the application identity would be \"myapp~app1\" in 6.0+ and \"myapp/app1\" in previous versions. 
let opts = {
  'forceRemove': true, // Boolean | Remove a Service Fabric application or service forcefully without going through the graceful shutdown sequence. This parameter can be used to forcefully delete an application or service for which delete is timing out due to issues in the service code that prevents graceful close of replicas.
  'timeout': 60 // Number | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.

## getApplicationInfo

> ApplicationInfo getApplicationInfo(apiVersion, applicationId, opts)

Gets information about a Service Fabric application.

Returns the information about the application that was created or in the process of being created in the Service Fabric cluster and whose name matches the one specified as the parameter. The response includes the name, type, status, parameters and other details about the application.

### Example

```javascript
import ServiceFabricClientApis from 'service_fabric_client_apis';

let apiInstance = new ServiceFabricClientApis.ApplicationApi();
let apiVersion = "'6.0'"; // String | The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be \"6.0\".  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. 
let applicationId = "applicationId_example"; // String | The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \"~\" character. For example, if the application name is \"fabric:/myapp/app1\", the application identity would be \"myapp~app1\" in 6.0+ and \"myapp/app1\" in previous versions. 
let opts = {
  'excludeApplicationParameters': false, // Boolean | The flag that specifies whether application parameters will be excluded from the result.
  'timeout': 60 // Number | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.

## getDeployedApplicationHealthUsingPolicy

> DeployedApplicationHealth getDeployedApplicationHealthUsingPolicy(apiVersion, nodeName, applicationId, opts)

Gets the information about health of an application deployed on a Service Fabric node. using the specified policy.

Gets the information about health of an application deployed on a Service Fabric node using the specified policy. Use EventsHealthStateFilter to optionally filter for the collection of HealthEvent objects reported on the deployed application based on health state. Use DeployedServicePackagesHealthStateFilter to optionally filter for DeployedServicePackageHealth children based on health state. Use ApplicationHealthPolicy to optionally override the health policies used to evaluate the health. This API only uses &#39;ConsiderWarningAsError&#39; field of the ApplicationHealthPolicy. The rest of the fields are ignored while evaluating the health of the deployed application. 

### Example

```javascript
import ServiceFabricClientApis from 'service_fabric_client_apis';

let apiInstance = new ServiceFabricClientApis.ApplicationApi();
let apiVersion = "'6.0'"; // String | The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be \"6.0\".  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. 
let nodeName = "nodeName_example"; // String | The name of the node.
let applicationId = "applicationId_example"; // String | The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \"~\" character. For example, if the application name is \"fabric:/myapp/app1\", the application identity would be \"myapp~app1\" in 6.0+ and \"myapp/app1\" in previous versions. 
let opts = {
  'eventsHealthStateFilter': 0, // Number | Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on health state. The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states. Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.  - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero. - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1. - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2. - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4. - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8. - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535. 
  'deployedServicePackagesHealthStateFilter': 0, // Number | Allows filtering of the deployed service package health state objects returned in the result of deployed application health query based on their health state. The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states. Only deployed service packages that match the filter are returned. All deployed service packages are used to evaluate the aggregated health state of the deployed application. If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value can be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of service packages with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.  - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero. - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1. - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2. - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4. - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8. - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535. 
  'excludeHealthStatistics': false, // Boolean | Indicates whether the health statistics should be returned as part of the query result. False by default. The statistics show the number of children entities in health state Ok, Warning, and Error. 
  'timeout': 60, // Number | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
  'applicationHealthPolicy': new ServiceFabricClientApis.ApplicationHealthPolicy() // ApplicationHealthPolicy | Describes the health policies used to evaluate the health of an application or one of its children. If not present, the health evaluation uses the health policy from application manifest or the default health policy.

## reportApplicationHealth

> reportApplicationHealth(apiVersion, applicationId, healthInformation, opts)

Sends a health report on the Service Fabric application.

Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric application. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, get application health and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section. 

### Example

```javascript
import ServiceFabricClientApis from 'service_fabric_client_apis';

let apiInstance = new ServiceFabricClientApis.ApplicationApi();
let apiVersion = "'6.0'"; // String | The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be \"6.0\".

However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. 
let applicationId = "applicationId_example"; // String | The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \"~\" character. For example, if the application name is \"fabric:/myapp/app1\", the application identity would be \"myapp~app1\" in 6.0+ and \"myapp/app1\" in previous versions. 
let healthInformation = new ServiceFabricClientApis.HealthInformation(); // HealthInformation | Describes the health information for the health report. This information needs to be present in all of the health reports sent to the health manager.
let opts = {
  'immediate': false, // Boolean | A flag which indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from Http Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the Http Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the Http Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the Http Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately. 
  'timeout': 60 // Number | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.

## reportDeployedApplicationHealth

> reportDeployedApplicationHealth(apiVersion, nodeName, applicationId, healthInformation, opts)

Sends a health report on the Service Fabric application deployed on a Service Fabric node.

Reports health state of the application deployed on a Service Fabric node. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Service, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, get deployed application health and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section.

Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.  | [default to &#39;6.0&#39;]
 **nodeName** | **String**| The name of the node. | 
 **applicationId** | **String**| The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the &#39;fabric:&#39; URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \&quot;~\&quot; character. For example, if the application name is \&quot;fabric:/myapp/app1\&quot;, the application identity would be \&quot;myapp~app1\&quot; in 6.0+ and \&quot;myapp/app1\&quot; in previous versions.  | 
 **healthInformation** | [**HealthInformation**](HealthInformation.md)| Describes the health information for the health report. This information needs to be present in all of the health reports sent to the health manager. | 
 **immediate** | **Boolean**| A flag which indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from Http Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the Http Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the Http Gateway is closed or the message doesn&#39;t reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the Http Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately.  | [optional] [default to false]
 **timeout** | **Number**| The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. | [optional] [default to 60]

## resumeApplicationUpgrade

> resumeApplicationUpgrade(apiVersion, applicationId, resumeApplicationUpgradeDescription, opts)

Resumes upgrading an application in the Service Fabric cluster.

Resumes an unmonitored manual Service Fabric application upgrade. Service Fabric upgrades one upgrade domain at a time. For unmonitored manual upgrades, after Service Fabric finishes an upgrade domain, it waits for you to call this API before proceeding to the next upgrade domain.

### Example

```javascript
import ServiceFabricClientApis from 'service_fabric_client_apis';

let apiInstance = new ServiceFabricClientApis.ApplicationApi();
let apiVersion = "'6.0'"; // String | The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be \"6.0\".  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. 
let applicationId = "applicationId_example"; // String | The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \"~\" character. For example, if the application name is \"fabric:/myapp/app1\", the application identity would be \"myapp~app1\" in 6.0+ and \"myapp/app1\" in previous versions. 
let resumeApplicationUpgradeDescription = new ServiceFabricClientApis.ResumeApplicationUpgradeDescription(); // ResumeApplicationUpgradeDescription | Describes the parameters for resuming an application upgrade.
let opts = {
  'timeout': 60 // Number | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
};
apiInstance.resumeApplicationUpgrade(apiVersion, applicationId, resumeApplicationUpgradeDescription, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully.');
  }
