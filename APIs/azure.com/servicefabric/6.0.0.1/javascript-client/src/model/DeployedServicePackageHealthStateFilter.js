/**
 * The filter for the health state of the deployed service packages. It allows selecting deployed service packages if they match the desired health states. The possible values are integer value of one of the following health states. Only deployed service packages that match the filter are returned. All deployed service packages are used to evaluate the parent deployed application aggregated health state. If not specified, default value is None, unless the deployed service package id is specified. If the filter has default value and deployed service package id is specified, the matching deployed service package is returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches deployed service packages with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).  - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero. - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1. - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2. - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4. - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8. - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.
