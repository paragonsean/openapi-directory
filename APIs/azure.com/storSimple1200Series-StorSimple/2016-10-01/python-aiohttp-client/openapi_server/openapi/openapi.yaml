                      \ or paused on the hypervisor. In Hyper-V, your virtual array\
                      \ will be paused automatically when the volume that stores snapshots\
                      \ or virtual hard disks, runs out of available storage. The\
                      \ state of the virtual array is listed as <i>\"paused-critical\"\
                      </i> in Hyper-V Manager. Resolve this by creating additional\
                      \ space on the volume. If you still cannot connect, check the\
                      \ Hyper-V host or ESX server to ensure that the VM is healthy.<br/><br/>\r\
                      \n\t2. The virtual array is not able to communicate with the\
                      \ StorSimple Device Manager service. In the local web UI of\
                      \ the virtual array, go to <b>Troubleshooting > Diagnostic tests</b>\

                      \ issues. <br/> <br/>\r\n  If the issue persists, contact your\
