### Return type

null (empty response body)

### Authorization

[api_key](../README.md#api_key), [azure_auth](../README.md#azure_auth)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: application/json; odata=minimalmetadata
 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **201** | The request to the Batch service was successful. |  * ETag - The ETag HTTP response header. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the resource has changed between requests. In particular, you can pass the ETag to one of the If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match or If-None-Match headers. <br>  * client-request-id - The client-request-id provided by the client during the request. This will be returned only if the return-client-request-id parameter was set to true. <br>  * DataServiceId - The OData ID of the resource to which the request applied. <br>  * Last-Modified - The time at which the resource was last modified. <br>  * request-id - A unique identifier for the request that was made to the Batch service. If a request is consistently failing and you have verified that the request is properly formulated, you may use this value to report the error to Microsoft. In your report, include the value of this request ID, the approximate time that the request was made, the Batch account against which the request was made, and the region that account resides in. <br>  |
| **0** | The error from the Batch service. |  -  |

<a id="jobScheduleDelete"></a>
# **jobScheduleDelete**
> jobScheduleDelete(jobScheduleId, apiVersion, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Deletes a job schedule from the specified account.

When you delete a job schedule, this also deletes all jobs and tasks under that schedule. When tasks are deleted, all the files in their working directories on the compute nodes are also deleted (the retention period is ignored). The job schedule statistics are no longer accessible once the job schedule is deleted, though they are still counted towards account lifetime statistics.

# **jobSchedulePatch**
> jobSchedulePatch(jobScheduleId, apiVersion, jobSchedulePatchParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Updates the properties of the specified job schedule.

This replaces only the job schedule properties specified in the request. For example, if the schedule property is not specified with this request, then the Batch service will keep the existing schedule. Changes to a job schedule only impact jobs created by the schedule after the update has taken place; currently running jobs are unaffected.

### Return type

null (empty response body)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: Not defined
 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **202** | The request to the Batch service was successful. |  * ETag - The ETag HTTP response header. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the resource has changed between requests. In particular, you can pass the ETag to one of the If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match or If-None-Match headers. <br>  * client-request-id - The client-request-id provided by the client during the request. This will be returned only if the return-client-request-id parameter was set to true. <br>  * DataServiceId - The OData ID of the resource to which the request applied. <br>  * Last-Modified - The time at which the resource was last modified. <br>  * request-id - A unique identifier for the request that was made to the Batch service. If a request is consistently failing and you have verified that the request is properly formulated, you may use this value to report the error to Microsoft. In your report, include the value of this request ID, the approximate time that the request was made, the Batch account against which the request was made, and the region that account resides in. <br>  |
| **0** | The error from the Batch service. |  -  |

# **jobScheduleUpdate**
> jobScheduleUpdate(jobScheduleId, apiVersion, jobScheduleUpdateParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Updates the properties of the specified job schedule.

This fully replaces all the updatable properties of the job schedule. For example, if the schedule property is not specified with this request, then the Batch service will remove the existing schedule. Changes to a job schedule only impact jobs created by the schedule after the update has taken place; currently running jobs are unaffected.
