# **taskAdd**
> taskAdd(jobId, apiVersion, task, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate)

Adds a task to the specified job.

The maximum lifetime of a task from addition to completion is 180 days. If a task has not completed within 180 days of being added it will be terminated by the Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.

| **task** | [**TaskAddParameter**](TaskAddParameter.md)| The task to be added. | |

| **ocpDate** | **String**| The time the request was issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly. | [optional] |

### Return type

null (empty response body)

### Authorization

[api_key](../README.md#api_key), [azure_auth](../README.md#azure_auth)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: application/json; odata=minimalmetadata
 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **201** | The request to the Batch service was successful. |  * ETag - The ETag HTTP response header. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the resource has changed between requests. In particular, you can pass the ETag to one of the If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match or If-None-Match headers. <br>  * client-request-id - The client-request-id provided by the client during the request. This will be returned only if the return-client-request-id parameter was set to true. <br>  * DataServiceId - The OData ID of the resource to which the request applied. <br>  * Last-Modified - The time at which the resource was last modified. <br>  * request-id - A unique identifier for the request that was made to the Batch service. If a request is consistently failing and you have verified that the request is properly formulated, you may use this value to report the error to Microsoft. In your report, include the value of this request ID, the approximate time that the request was made, the Batch account against which the request was made, and the region that account resides in. <br>  |
| **0** | The error from the Batch service. |  -  |

<a id="taskAddCollection"></a>
# **taskAddCollection**
> TaskAddCollectionResult taskAddCollection(jobId, apiVersion, taskCollection, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate)

Adds a collection of tasks to the specified job.

Note that each task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not return the results for each task in the same order the tasks were submitted in this request. If the server times out or the connection is closed during the request, the request may have been partially or fully processed, or not at all. In such cases, the user should re-issue the request. Note that it is up to the user to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a request. For example, you should use the same task IDs during a retry so that if the prior operation succeeded, the retry will not create extra tasks unexpectedly. If the response contains any tasks which failed to add, a client can retry the request. In a retry, it is most efficient to resubmit only tasks that failed to add, and to omit tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt. The maximum lifetime of a task from addition to completion is 180 days. If a task has not completed within 180 days of being added it will be terminated by the Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.

<a id="taskDelete"></a>
# **taskDelete**
> taskDelete(jobId, taskId, apiVersion, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Deletes a task from the specified job.

When a task is deleted, all of the files in its directory on the compute node where it ran are also deleted (regardless of the retention time). For multi-instance tasks, the delete task operation applies synchronously to the primary task; subtasks and their files are then deleted asynchronously in the background.

Lists all of the subtasks that are associated with the specified multi-instance task.

If the task is not a multi-instance task then this returns an empty collection.

<a id="taskReactivate"></a>
# **taskReactivate**
> taskReactivate(jobId, taskId, apiVersion, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Reactivates a task, allowing it to run again even if its retry count has been exhausted.

Reactivation makes a task eligible to be retried again up to its maximum retry count. The task&#39;s state is changed to active. As the task is no longer in the completed state, any previous exit code or failure information is no longer available after reactivation. Each time a task is reactivated, its retry count is reset to 0. Reactivation will fail for tasks that are not completed or that previously completed successfully (with an exit code of 0). Additionally, it will fail if the job has completed (or is terminating or deleting).

### Return type

null (empty response body)

### Authorization

[api_key](../README.md#api_key), [azure_auth](../README.md#azure_auth)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: application/json; odata=minimalmetadata
 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **200** | The request to the Batch service was successful. |  * ETag - The ETag HTTP response header. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the resource has changed between requests. In particular, you can pass the ETag to one of the If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match or If-None-Match headers. <br>  * client-request-id - The client-request-id provided by the client during the request. This will be returned only if the return-client-request-id parameter was set to true. <br>  * DataServiceId - The OData ID of the resource to which the request applied. <br>  * Last-Modified - The time at which the resource was last modified. <br>  * request-id - A unique identifier for the request that was made to the Batch service. If a request is consistently failing and you have verified that the request is properly formulated, you may use this value to report the error to Microsoft. In your report, include the value of this request ID, the approximate time that the request was made, the Batch account against which the request was made, and the region that account resides in. <br>  |
| **0** | The error from the Batch service. |  -  |
