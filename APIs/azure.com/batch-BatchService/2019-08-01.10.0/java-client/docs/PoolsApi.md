### Return type

null (empty response body)

### Authorization

[api_key](../README.md#api_key), [azure_auth](../README.md#azure_auth)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: application/json; odata=minimalmetadata
 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **201** | The request to the Batch service was successful. |  * ETag - The ETag HTTP response header. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the resource has changed between requests. In particular, you can pass the ETag to one of the If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match or If-None-Match headers. <br>  * client-request-id - The client-request-id provided by the client during the request. This will be returned only if the return-client-request-id parameter was set to true. <br>  * DataServiceId - The OData ID of the resource to which the request applied. <br>  * Last-Modified - The time at which the resource was last modified. <br>  * request-id - A unique identifier for the request that was made to the Batch service. If a request is consistently failing and you have verified that the request is properly formulated, you may use this value to report the error to Microsoft. In your report, include the value of this request ID, the approximate time that the request was made, the Batch Account against which the request was made, and the region that Account resides in. <br>  |
| **0** | The error from the Batch service. |  -  |

<a id="poolDelete"></a>
# **poolDelete**
> poolDelete(poolId, apiVersion, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Deletes a Pool from the specified Account.

When you request that a Pool be deleted, the following actions occur: the Pool state is set to deleting; any ongoing resize operation on the Pool are stopped; the Batch service starts resizing the Pool to zero Compute Nodes; any Tasks running on existing Compute Nodes are terminated and requeued (as if a resize Pool operation had been requested with the default requeue option); finally, the Pool is removed from the system. Because running Tasks are requeued, the user can rerun these Tasks by updating their Job to target a different Pool. The Tasks can then run on the new Pool. If you want to override the requeue behavior, then you should call resize Pool explicitly to shrink the Pool to zero size before deleting the Pool. If you call an Update, Patch or Delete API on a Pool in the deleting state, it will fail with HTTP status code 409 with error code PoolBeingDeleted.

# **poolEnableAutoScale**
> poolEnableAutoScale(poolId, apiVersion, poolEnableAutoScaleParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Enables automatic scaling for a Pool.

You cannot enable automatic scaling on a Pool if a resize operation is in progress on the Pool. If automatic scaling of the Pool is currently disabled, you must specify a valid autoscale formula as part of the request. If automatic scaling of the Pool is already enabled, you may specify a new autoscale formula and/or a new evaluation interval. You cannot call this API for the same Pool more than once every 30 seconds.

# **poolEvaluateAutoScale**
> AutoScaleRun poolEvaluateAutoScale(poolId, apiVersion, poolEvaluateAutoScaleParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate)

Gets the result of evaluating an automatic scaling formula on the Pool.

This API is primarily for validating an autoscale formula, as it simply returns the result without applying the formula to the Pool. The Pool must have auto scaling enabled in order to evaluate a formula.

# **poolListUsageMetrics**
> PoolListUsageMetricsResult poolListUsageMetrics(apiVersion, starttime, endtime, $filter, maxresults, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate)

Lists the usage metrics, aggregated by Pool across individual time intervals, for the specified Account.

If you do not specify a $filter clause including a poolId, the response includes all Pools that existed in the Account in the time range of the returned aggregation intervals. If you do not specify a $filter clause including a startTime or endTime these filters default to the start and end times of the last aggregation interval currently available; that is, only the last aggregation interval is returned.

<a id="poolResize"></a>
# **poolResize**
> poolResize(poolId, apiVersion, poolResizeParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Changes the number of Compute Nodes that are assigned to a Pool.

You can only resize a Pool when its allocation state is steady. If the Pool is already resizing, the request fails with status code 409. When you resize a Pool, the Pool&#39;s allocation state changes from steady to resizing. You cannot resize Pools which are configured for automatic scaling. If you try to do this, the Batch service returns an error 409. If you resize a Pool downwards, the Batch service chooses which Compute Nodes to remove. To remove specific Compute Nodes, use the Pool remove Compute Nodes API instead.

<a id="poolStopResize"></a>
# **poolStopResize**
> poolStopResize(poolId, apiVersion, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Stops an ongoing resize operation on the Pool.

This does not restore the Pool to its previous state before the resize operation: it only stops any further changes being made, and the Pool maintains its current state. After stopping, the Pool stabilizes at the number of Compute Nodes it was at when the stop operation was done. During the stop operation, the Pool allocation state changes first to stopping and then to steady. A resize operation need not be an explicit resize Pool request; this API can also be used to halt the initial sizing of the Pool when it is created.

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **202** | The request to the Batch service was successful. |  * ETag - The ETag HTTP response header. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the resource has changed between requests. In particular, you can pass the ETag to one of the If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match or If-None-Match headers. <br>  * client-request-id - The client-request-id provided by the client during the request. This will be returned only if the return-client-request-id parameter was set to true. <br>  * DataServiceId - The OData ID of the resource to which the request applied. <br>  * Last-Modified - The time at which the resource was last modified. <br>  * request-id - A unique identifier for the request that was made to the Batch service. If a request is consistently failing and you have verified that the request is properly formulated, you may use this value to report the error to Microsoft. In your report, include the value of this request ID, the approximate time that the request was made, the Batch Account against which the request was made, and the region that Account resides in. <br>  |
| **0** | The error from the Batch service. If you call this API on a Pool which is not in the resizing state, the request fails with HTTP status code 409. |  -  |

# **poolUpdateProperties**
> poolUpdateProperties(poolId, apiVersion, poolUpdatePropertiesParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate)

Updates the properties of the specified Pool.

This fully replaces all the updatable properties of the Pool. For example, if the Pool has a StartTask associated with it and if StartTask is not specified with this request, then the Batch service will remove the existing StartTask.

### Example
```java

    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //api_key.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: azure_auth
    OAuth azure_auth = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("azure_auth");
    azure_auth.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    Boolean returnClientRequestId = false; // Boolean | Whether the server should return the client-request-id in the response.
    String ocpDate = "ocpDate_example"; // String | The time the request was issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly.
    try {
      apiInstance.poolUpdateProperties(poolId, apiVersion, poolUpdatePropertiesParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling PoolsApi#poolUpdateProperties");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
