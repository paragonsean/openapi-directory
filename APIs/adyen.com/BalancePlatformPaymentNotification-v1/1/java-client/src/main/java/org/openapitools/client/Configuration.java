 * Payment webhooks (deprecated)
 * The payment webhooks are deprecated. Use the [accounting webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/transfer-webhooks/latest/overview) instead.  Adyen sends webhooks to inform your system about the creation of payment resources and money movements in your platform.  You can use these webhooks to build your implementation. For example, you can use this information to update balances in your own dashboards or to keep track of incoming funds.
