/*
 * Capital API
 * Adyen Capital allows you to build an embedded financing offering for your users to serve their operational needs. Learn more about [Adyen Capital](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/capital).  ## Authentication Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:   ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ ... ```  Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:  ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -U \"ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \\ ... ``` ## Roles and permissions To use the Capital API, you need an additional role for your API credential. Your Adyen contact will set up the roles and permissions for you. ## Versioning The Capital API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/btl/v3/grants ``` ## Going live When going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/btl/v3`.
