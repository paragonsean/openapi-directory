------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**allow3DS2** | **String** | Indicates if you are able to process 3D Secure 2 transactions natively on your payment page. Send this parameter when you are using &#x60;/payments&#x60; endpoint with any of our [native 3D Secure 2 solutions](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/3d-secure/native-3ds2).   &gt; This parameter only indicates readiness to support native 3D Secure 2 authentication. To specify if you _want_ to perform 3D Secure, use [Dynamic 3D Secure](/risk-management/dynamic-3d-secure) or send the &#x60;executeThreeD&#x60; parameter.  Possible values: * **true** - Ready to support native 3D Secure 2 authentication. Setting this to true does not mean always applying 3D Secure 2. Adyen still selects the version of 3D Secure based on configuration to optimize authorisation rates and improve the shopper&#39;s experience. * **false** – Not ready to support native 3D Secure 2 authentication. Adyen will not offer 3D Secure 2 to your shopper regardless of your configuration.  | [optional]

**executeThreeD** | **String** | Indicates if you want to perform 3D Secure authentication on a transaction.   &gt; Alternatively, you can use [Dynamic 3D Secure](/risk-management/dynamic-3d-secure) to configure rules for applying 3D Secure.  Possible values: * **true** – Perform 3D Secure authentication. * **false** – Don&#39;t perform 3D Secure authentication. Note that this setting results in refusals if the issuer mandates 3D Secure because of the PSD2 directive  or other, national regulations.   | [optional]

The following rules apply: * If you prefer 2.1.0 or 2.2.0 but we receive a negative &#x60;transStatus&#x60; in the &#x60;ARes&#x60;, we will apply the fallback policy configured in your account. For example, if the configuration is to fall back to 3D Secure 1, we will apply version 1.0.2. * If you prefer 2.1.0 or 2.2.0 but the BIN is not enrolled, you will receive an error.   | [optional]
