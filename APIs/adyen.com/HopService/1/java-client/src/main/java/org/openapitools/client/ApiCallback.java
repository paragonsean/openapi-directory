/*
 * Hosted onboarding API
 * This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting your implementation, refer to our [new integration guide](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms) instead.  The Hosted onboarding API provides endpoints that you can use to generate links to Adyen-hosted pages, such as an [onboarding page](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/hosted-onboarding-page) or a [PCI compliance questionnaire](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/platforms-for-partners). You can provide these links to your account holders so that they can complete their onboarding.  ## Authentication Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:   ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ ... ```  Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:  ``` curl -U \"ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ ... ``` When going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).  ## Versioning The Hosted onboarding API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Hop/v1/getOnboardingUrl ```
