  description: "Adyen sends webhooks to inform your system about events that occur\
    \ in your platform. These events include, for example, when an account holder's\
    \ capabilities are updated, or when a sweep configuration is created or updated.\
    \ \nWhen an event occurs, Adyen makes an HTTP POST request to a URL on your server\
    \ and includes the details of the event in the request body.\n\nYou can use these\
    \ webhooks to build your implementation. For example, you can use this information\
    \ to update internal statuses when the status of a capability is changed."

            * **monthly**: push out funds every first of the month at 07:00 AM CET.

            * **balance**: pull in funds instantly if the balance is less than or equal to the `triggerAmount`.
            You can only use this for sweeps of `type` **pull** and when the source is a `merchantAccount` or `transferInstrument`.
            If the source is transferInstrument, merchant account identifier is still required, with which you want to process the transaction.
