    This API allows you to interact with the VictorOps platform in various ways. Your account may be limited to a total number of API calls per month. Also, some of these API calls have rate limits.  NOTE: In this documentation when creating a sample curl request (clicking the TRY IT OUT! button), in some API viewing interfaces, the &#39;@&#39; in an email address may be encoded. Please note that the REST endpoints will not process the encoded version. Make sure that the encoded character &#39;%40&#39; is changed to its unencoded form before submitting the curl request.
