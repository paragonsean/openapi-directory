NOTE: In this documentation when creating a sample curl request (clicking the TRY IT OUT! button), in some API viewing interfaces, the '@' in an email address may be encoded. Please note that the REST endpoints will not process the encoded version. Make sure that the encoded character '%40' is changed to its unencoded form before submitting the curl request.
