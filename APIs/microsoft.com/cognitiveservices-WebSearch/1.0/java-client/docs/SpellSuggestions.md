# SpellSuggestions

Defines a suggested query string that likely represents the user's intent. The search results include this response if Bing determines that the user may have intended to search for something different. For example, if the user searches for alon brown, Bing may determine that the user likely intended to search for Alton Brown instead (based on past searches by others of Alon Brown).
