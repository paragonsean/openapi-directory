          \ across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements,\
          \ and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different\
          \ flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple\
          \ requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights.\
          \ Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent\
          \ user experience. For example, if the second request has a different flight\
          \ assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing\
          \ can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client IDâ€™s search\
          \ history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this\
          \ header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated\
          \ by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality of\
          \ results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through\
          \ rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider\
          \ this header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests\
          \ for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer\
          \ to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates\
          \ via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses\
          \ your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client\
          \ ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an\
          \ ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time\
          \ that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first time\
          \ the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing\
          \ API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\
          \ client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\
          \ to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\
          \ For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage\
          \ to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device,\
          \ get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include\
          \ this header. If the response includes this header, capture the client\
          \ ID and use it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device.\
