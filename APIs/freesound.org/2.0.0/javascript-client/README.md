# freesound

Freesound - JavaScript client for freesound
With the Freesound APIv2 you can browse, search, and retrieve information about Freesound users, packs, and the sounds themselves of course. You can find similar sounds to a given target (based on content analysis) and retrieve automatically extracted features from audio files, as well as perform advanced queries combining content analysis features and other metadata (tags, etc...). With the Freesound APIv2, you can also upload, comment, rate and bookmark sounds!

## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install freesound --save
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your freesound from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### git

If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var Freesound = require('freesound');


var api = new Freesound.SearchApi()
var opts = {
  'query': "query_example", // {String} The query! The query is the main parameter used to define a query. You can type several terms separated by spaces or phrases wrapped inside quote ‘”’ characters. For every term, you can also use ‘+’ and ‘-‘ modifier characters to indicate that a term is “mandatory” or “prohibited” (by default, terms are considered to be “mandatory”). For example, in a query such as query=term_a -term_b, sounds including term_b will not match the search criteria. The query does a weighted search over some sound properties including sound tags, the sound name, its description, pack name and the sound id. Therefore, searching for query=123 will find you sounds with id 1234, sounds that have 1234 in the description, in the tags, etc. You’ll find some examples below. Using an empty query (query= or query=\"\") will return all Freeosund sounds.
  'filter': "filter_example", // {String} Allows filtering query results. See below for more information.
  'sort': "sort_example", // {String} Indicates how query results should be sorted. See below for a list of the sorting options. By default `sort=score`. <p> <table>   <tr>     <th>Option</th>     <th>Explanation</th>   </tr>   <tr>     <td>score</td>     <td>Sort by a relevance score returned by our search engine (default).</td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td>duration_desc     <td>Sort by the duration of the sounds, longest sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>duration_asc     <td>Same as above, but shortest sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>created_desc     <td>Sort by the date of when the sound was added. newest sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>created_asc     <td>Same as above, but oldest sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>downloads_desc     <td>Sort by the number of downloads, most downloaded sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>downloads_asc     <td>Same as above, but least downloaded sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>rating_desc     <td>Sort by the average rating given to the sounds, highest rated first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>rating_asc     <td>Same as above, but lowest rated sounds first.   </tr> </table> </p>
  'groupByPack': 56, // {Number} This parameter represents a boolean option to indicate whether to collapse results belonging to sounds of the same pack into single entries in the results list. If `group_by_pack=1` and search results contain more than one sound that belongs to the same pack, only one sound for each distinct pack is returned (sounds with no packs are returned as well). However, the returned sound will feature two extra properties to access these other sounds omitted from the results list: `n_from_same_pack`: indicates how many other results belong to the same pack (and have not been returned) `more_from_same_pack`: uri pointing to the list of omitted sound results of the same pack (also including the result which has already been returned). See examples below. By default `group_by_pack=0`.
  'page': 1, // {Number} Query results are paginated, this parameter indicates what page should be returned. By default `page=1`.
  'pageSize': 15 // {Number} Indicates the number of sounds per page to include in the result. By default `page_size=15`, and the maximum is `page_size=150`. Not that with bigger `page_size`, more data will need to be transferred.
};
var callback = function(error, data, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
};
api.searchText(opts, callback);

```
