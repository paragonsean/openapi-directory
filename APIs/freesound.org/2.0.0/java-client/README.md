# openapi-java-client

Freesound
- API version: 2.0.0
  - Build date: 2024-10-12T10:04:17.650470-04:00[America/New_York]
  - Generator version: 7.9.0

With the Freesound APIv2 you can browse, search, and retrieve information about Freesound users, packs, and the sounds themselves of course. You can find similar sounds to a given target (based on content analysis) and retrieve automatically extracted features from audio files, as well as perform advanced queries combining content analysis features and other metadata (tags, etc...). With the Freesound APIv2, you can also upload, comment, rate and bookmark sounds!

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:
1. Java 1.8+
2. Maven (3.8.3+)/Gradle (7.2+)

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

### Maven users

Add this dependency to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId>
  <artifactId>openapi-java-client</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()     // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to maven central.
    mavenLocal()       // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to the local maven repo.
  }

  dependencies {
     implementation "org.openapitools:openapi-java-client:2.0.0"
  }
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

* `target/openapi-java-client-2.0.0.jar`
* `target/lib/*.jar`

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.model.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.SearchApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("http://www.freesound.org/apiv2");

    SearchApi apiInstance = new SearchApi(defaultClient);
    String query = "query_example"; // String | The query! The query is the main parameter used to define a query. You can type several terms separated by spaces or phrases wrapped inside quote ‘”’ characters. For every term, you can also use ‘+’ and ‘-‘ modifier characters to indicate that a term is “mandatory” or “prohibited” (by default, terms are considered to be “mandatory”). For example, in a query such as query=term_a -term_b, sounds including term_b will not match the search criteria. The query does a weighted search over some sound properties including sound tags, the sound name, its description, pack name and the sound id. Therefore, searching for query=123 will find you sounds with id 1234, sounds that have 1234 in the description, in the tags, etc. You’ll find some examples below. Using an empty query (query= or query=\"\") will return all Freeosund sounds.
    String filter = "filter_example"; // String | Allows filtering query results. See below for more information.
    String sort = "score"; // String | Indicates how query results should be sorted. See below for a list of the sorting options. By default `sort=score`. <p> <table>   <tr>     <th>Option</th>     <th>Explanation</th>   </tr>   <tr>     <td>score</td>     <td>Sort by a relevance score returned by our search engine (default).</td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td>duration_desc     <td>Sort by the duration of the sounds, longest sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>duration_asc     <td>Same as above, but shortest sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>created_desc     <td>Sort by the date of when the sound was added. newest sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>created_asc     <td>Same as above, but oldest sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>downloads_desc     <td>Sort by the number of downloads, most downloaded sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>downloads_asc     <td>Same as above, but least downloaded sounds first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>rating_desc     <td>Sort by the average rating given to the sounds, highest rated first.   </tr>   <tr>     <td>rating_asc     <td>Same as above, but lowest rated sounds first.   </tr> </table> </p>
    Integer groupByPack = 56; // Integer | This parameter represents a boolean option to indicate whether to collapse results belonging to sounds of the same pack into single entries in the results list. If `group_by_pack=1` and search results contain more than one sound that belongs to the same pack, only one sound for each distinct pack is returned (sounds with no packs are returned as well). However, the returned sound will feature two extra properties to access these other sounds omitted from the results list: `n_from_same_pack`: indicates how many other results belong to the same pack (and have not been returned) `more_from_same_pack`: uri pointing to the list of omitted sound results of the same pack (also including the result which has already been returned). See examples below. By default `group_by_pack=0`.
    Integer page = 1; // Integer | Query results are paginated, this parameter indicates what page should be returned. By default `page=1`.
    Integer pageSize = 15; // Integer | Indicates the number of sounds per page to include in the result. By default `page_size=15`, and the maximum is `page_size=150`. Not that with bigger `page_size`, more data will need to be transferred.
    try {
      List<Sound> result = apiInstance.searchText(query, filter, sort, groupByPack, page, pageSize);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling SearchApi#searchText");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

```

## Documentation for Authorization

Endpoints do not require authorization.


## Recommendation

It's recommended to create an instance of `ApiClient` per thread in a multithreaded environment to avoid any potential issues.
