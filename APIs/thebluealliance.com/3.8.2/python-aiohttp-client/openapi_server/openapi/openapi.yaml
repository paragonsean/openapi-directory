    \ 3.5.2-3.6.0: Added `school_name` to the Team model. 3.5.1-3.5.2: Removed `key`\

    \ Added Timeseries models and endpoints. 3.02.0 - 3.02.1: Fixed the model for\
    \ `/team/{team_key}/districts` to match return from API. 3.1.0 - 3.02.0: Added\
    \ `tba_gameData` to score breakdown and a leading zero to the minor version number\
    \ to allow for easier sorting later. 3.0.5 - 3.1.0: Version bump for 2018 added\
    \ fields and endpoints. Models Updated: `Team_Event_Status`, `Media`, 2018 Score\
    \ Breakdowns. Endpoints Added: `/team/{team_key}/events/{year}/statuses`, `/event/{event_key}/teams/statuses`\
    \ 3.0.4 - 3.0.5: Minor spelling fixes. Remove 2016 fields from `Match_Score_Breakdown_2017_Alliance`\
    \ model. Fix `first_event_id` in `Event` model to correct type. Update `Media`.`type`\
    \ enum. --- 3.0.3 - 3.0.4: Correct syntax in `Team_Event_Status_playoff` object,\
    \ include descriptions in `Event_District_Points` and fix the path in `Team_Event_Status_playoff.properties.record`\
    \ in order to more closely match Swagger spec. Fix syntax of `Match.video` to\
    \ be correct and accurately reflect what is returned by the API. --- 3.0.2 - 3.0.3:\
    \ `extra_stats` and `extra_stats_info` added to `Event_Ranking` model. Corrected\
    \ match video property claiming to use the `Media` model, which it doesn't. Added\
    \ `first_event_code` to the `Event` model. Added `/team/{team_key}/media/tag/{media_tag}`\
    \ and year endpoints. Added `dq_team_keys` to `Match_alliance` model.  --- 3.0.1\
    \ - 3.0.2: `Team_Event_Status` and `Event_Ranking` model documentation changed\
    \ to reflect actual API return. Changes involved W-L-T and ranking properties.\
    \ --- 3.0.0 - 3.0.1: Descriptions updated to clarify some terms and improve grammar.\
    \ The `district` property on the `Event` object now points to the `District_List`\
    \ model, which was identical. `Required` fields on fully documented models now\
    \ represent fields that may not be `null`. `District_Ranking` model documented."
