# AccountBalance

The Banking Account Balances data type provides a list of balances for a bank account including end-of-day batch balance or running balances per transaction.  Responses are paged, so you should provide `page` and `pageSize` query parameters in your request.  > **How often should I pull Account Balances?** > > Because these balances are closing balances, we recommend you pull Account Balance no more frequently than daily. If you require a live intraday balance, this can be found for each account on the [Account](https://docs.codat.io/banking-api#/schemas/Account) data type. >  > Whilst you can choose to sync hourly, this may incur usage charges from Plaid or TrueLayer.
