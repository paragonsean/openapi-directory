        The admin should run this on behalf of a user who forgot their password.  The API will generate a password reset code which the admin should then provide to the user. The user can use their client to reset their password. Normally the password reset code is mailed to the user, but I didn't want to do this in this case because I didn't want to  introduce the complicated dependency of having an SMTP server just for this purpose. Doing it this way makes it easy for people to adopt this  API.
