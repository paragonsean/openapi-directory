departureboard.io API
- API version: 2.0
  - Build date: 2024-10-12T11:24:10.215346-04:00[America/New_York]
  - Generator version: 7.9.0

The departureboard.io is a high performance API written in Golang. Its goal is to provide to main functions:<br><br> (1): A JSON API interface to the legacy National Rail SOAP API: Giving developers the ability to pull live information on departures, arrivals, and services from National Rail, without having to use the legacy SOAP API provided by National Rail. Information is still pulled directly from National Rail in the background, providing the same level of real-time data without the additional complexity of having to interact with SOAP. <br><br>(2): A JSON API interface for additional National Rail information: Giving developers the ability to pull a range of information about the Rail Network, via a JSON API interface. This is not an offering that National Rail currently provide, and is custom developed. Data is sourced from periodically updated XML documents, parsed, and provided for consumption via the departureboard.io API.<br><br>This API is completely free to use for non-commercial purposes. You can explore the various sections of the documentation using the links below.<br><br> For more information please see <a href=\"https://api.departureboard.io\">https://api.departureboard.io</a>

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:
1. Java 1.8+
2. Maven (3.8.3+)/Gradle (7.2+)

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

### Maven users

Add this dependency to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId>
  <artifactId>openapi-java-client</artifactId>
  <version>2.0</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()     // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to maven central.
    mavenLocal()       // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to the local maven repo.
  }

  dependencies {
     implementation "org.openapitools:openapi-java-client:2.0"
  }
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

* `target/openapi-java-client-2.0.jar`
* `target/lib/*.jar`

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.model.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.DeparturesArrivalsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://api.departureboard.io/api/v2.0");

    DeparturesArrivalsApi apiInstance = new DeparturesArrivalsApi(defaultClient);
    String CRS = "CRS_example"; // String | The CRS (Computer Reservation System) for the Station you wish to get departure and arrival information for, e.g. KGX for London Kings Cross.
    String apiKey = "apiKey_example"; // String | The National Rail OpenLDBWS API Key to use for looking up service information. You must register with National Rail to obtain this key and whitelist it with us. See https://api.departureboard.io/docs/registration for more information.
    Integer numServices = 10; // Integer | The number of arriving and departing services to return. This is a maximum value, less may be returned if there is not a sufficient amount of services arriving to or departing from this station within the time window specified.
    Integer timeOffset = 0; // Integer | The time window in minutes to offset the arrival and departure information by. For example, a value of 20 will not show services arriving to or departing from the station within the next 20 minutes.
    Integer timeWindow = 120; // Integer | The time window in minutes to offset the arrival and departure information by. For example, a value of 20 will not show services arriving to or departing from the selected station within the next 20 minutes.
    Boolean serviceDetails = true; // Boolean | Should the response contain information on the calling points for each service? If set to false, calling points will not be returned.
    String filterStation = "filterStation_example"; // String | The CRS (Computer Reservation System) code to filter the results by. When setting this you must also set the filterType parameter. For example, performing a lookup for PAD (London Paddington) and setting filterStation to RED (Reading) and filterType to from, will only show services arriving to London Paddington that stopped at Reading. Setting a filter for getArrivalsAndDeparturesByCRS is similar to performing a getArrivalsByCRS or getDeparturesByCRS lookup, with the appropriate filterStation parameter. However using the getArrivalsAndDeparturesByCRS endpoint shows more details for each of the returned services.
    String filterType = "filterType_example"; // String | Determines if the filterStation parameter should be applied for services arriving to, or leaving from the selected station. Required if filterStation is set.
    try {
      apiInstance.getArrivalsAndDeparturesByCRS(CRS, apiKey, numServices, timeOffset, timeWindow, serviceDetails, filterStation, filterType);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling DeparturesArrivalsApi#getArrivalsAndDeparturesByCRS");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

```

## Documentation for API Endpoints

All URIs are relative to *https://api.departureboard.io/api/v2.0*

Class | Method | HTTP request | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
*DeparturesArrivalsApi* | [**getArrivalsAndDeparturesByCRS**](docs/DeparturesArrivalsApi.md#getArrivalsAndDeparturesByCRS) | **GET** /getArrivalsAndDeparturesByCRS/{CRS} | getArrivalsAndDeparturesByCRS is used to get a list of services arriving to and departing from a UK train station by the CRS (Computer Reservation System) code. This will typically return a list of train services, but will also return any replacement bus or ferry services that are in place.
*DeparturesArrivalsApi* | [**getArrivalsByCRS**](docs/DeparturesArrivalsApi.md#getArrivalsByCRS) | **GET** /getArrivalsByCRS/{CRS} | getArrivalsByCRS is used to get a list of services arriving to a UK train station by the CRS (Computer Reservation System) code. This will typically return a list of train services, but will also return any replacement bus or ferry services that are in place.
*DeparturesArrivalsApi* | [**getDeparturesByCRS**](docs/DeparturesArrivalsApi.md#getDeparturesByCRS) | **GET** /getDeparturesByCRS/{CRS} | getDeparturesByCRS is used to get a list of services departing from a UK train station by the CRS (Computer Reservation System) code. This will typically return a list of train services, but will also return any replacement bus or ferry services that are in place.
*FastestAndNextDeparturesApi* | [**getFastestDeparturesByCRS**](docs/FastestAndNextDeparturesApi.md#getFastestDeparturesByCRS) | **GET** /getFastestDeparturesByCRS/{CRS} | getFastestDeparturesByCRS is used to get the fastest next service running between two stations. Multiple destinations can be specified. This will typically return a single train service, but will also return a replacement bus or ferry service if in place.
*FastestAndNextDeparturesApi* | [**getNextDeparturesByCRS**](docs/FastestAndNextDeparturesApi.md#getNextDeparturesByCRS) | **GET** /getNextDeparturesByCRS/{CRS} | getNextDeparturesByCRS is used to get the next service running between two stations. Multiple destinations can be specified. This will typically return a single train service, but will also return a replacement bus or ferry service if in place. This will return the next departures for each of the filterList stations specified. It may not return the fastest next service. To get the fastest next service use the getFastestDeparturesByCRS endpoint.
*ServiceInformationApi* | [**getServiceDetailsByID**](docs/ServiceInformationApi.md#getServiceDetailsByID) | **GET** /getServiceDetailsByID/{serviceID} | getServiceDetailsByID is used to get information on a service, by the Service ID. This will typically return a train service, but will also return a bus and ferry services. The Service ID must be provided in the serviceIDUrlSafe format that is provided in the response for Arrival and Departure Boards. A service ID is specific to a station, and can only be looked up for a short time after a train/bus/ferry arrives at, or departs from a station. This is a National Rail limitation.
