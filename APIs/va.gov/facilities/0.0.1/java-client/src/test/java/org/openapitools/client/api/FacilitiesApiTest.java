/*
 * VA Facilities
 * ## Background  The VA Facilities API version 0 (v0) provides information about VA facilities, including locations, addresses, phone numbers, hours of operation, and available services.  This API gives information about several types of VA facilities: - Health facilities (vha) - Benefits facilities (vba) - Cemeteries (nca) - Vet Centers (vc)  ## Technical overview  For in-depth details on data sources for the Facilities API, [read our Facilities GitHub documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-facilities#readme).  Health service and service availability data for v0 of this API are based on historical data.  - Historical data is returned for the previous 30 days. - Data is based on both pending and completed appointments for a service at a given facility.   ### Authentication and Authorization  VA Facilities is an open data API. Open data API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token that's provided in an HTTP header with the name 'apikey'.  ### Test data  Test data for the sandbox environment is only for testing the API and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. After testing this API in sandbox, you can start the process of moving to production.  ### Facility ID formats  A facility ID has the format prefix_stationNumber. The prefix is nca, vc, vba, or vha. Cemeteries may be VA national cemeteries or non-national; non-national cemeteries have the station number prefixed with an s. There are no other constraints on the format. Some facility ID examples are: - Health: `vha_402GA` - Benefits: `vba_539GB` - National cemetery: `nca_063` - Non-national cemetery: `nca_s1082` - Vet Center: `vc_0872MVC`   ### Mobile facilities  The mobile health facilities move regularly within a region. If a facility comes back from this API with \"mobile\": \"true\", the latitude/longitude and address could be inaccurate. To get the exact current location, please call the mobile facility number listed.

     * Query facilities by location or IDs, with optional filters
     *
     * Query facilities by bounding box, latitude and longitude, state, visn, or zip code. Bounding box is specified as four &#x60;bbox[]&#x60; parameters, long1, lat1, long2, lat2. (Relative order is unimportant.)  A query by latitude and longitude returns all facilities in the system, sorted by distance from that location. Providing an optional radius in miles to this query will narrow the scope of the returned facilities to those falling within the specified radius from that location.  All location queries support filtering by facility type, available services, and mobile status.  One can also retrieve facilities by ID using a comma-separated list like &#x60;?ids&#x3D;id1,id2&#x60;. When requesting multiple facilities by ID, the API will return as many results as it can find matches for, omitting IDs where there is no match. It will not return an HTTP error code if it is unable to match a requested ID. Clients may supply IDs up to the limit their HTTP client enforces for URI path lengths. (Usually 2048 characters.)  Results are paginated. JSON responses include pagination information in the standard JSON API \&quot;links\&quot; and \&quot;meta\&quot; elements.   ### Parameter combinations You may optionally specify &#x60;page&#x60; and &#x60;per_page&#x60; with any query. You must specify one of the following parameter combinations:   - &#x60;bbox[]&#x60;, with the option of any combination of &#x60;type&#x60;, &#x60;services[]&#x60;, or &#x60;mobile&#x60;  - &#x60;ids&#x60;  - &#x60;lat&#x60; and &#x60;long&#x60;, with the option of any combination of &#x60;radius&#x60;, &#x60;ids&#x60;, &#x60;type&#x60;, &#x60;services[]&#x60;, or &#x60;mobile&#x60;  - &#x60;state&#x60;, with the option of any combination of &#x60;type&#x60;, &#x60;services[]&#x60;, or &#x60;mobile&#x60;  - &#x60;visn&#x60;  - &#x60;zip&#x60;, with the option of any combination of &#x60;type&#x60;, &#x60;services[]&#x60;, or &#x60;mobile&#x60;   Invalid combinations will return &#x60;400 Bad Request&#x60;.
