/**
 * VA Facilities
 * ## Background  The VA Facilities API version 0 (v0) provides information about VA facilities, including locations, addresses, phone numbers, hours of operation, and available services.  This API gives information about several types of VA facilities: - Health facilities (vha) - Benefits facilities (vba) - Cemeteries (nca) - Vet Centers (vc)  ## Technical overview  For in-depth details on data sources for the Facilities API, [read our Facilities GitHub documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-facilities#readme).  Health service and service availability data for v0 of this API are based on historical data.  - Historical data is returned for the previous 30 days. - Data is based on both pending and completed appointments for a service at a given facility.   ### Authentication and Authorization  VA Facilities is an open data API. Open data API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token that's provided in an HTTP header with the name 'apikey'.  ### Test data  Test data for the sandbox environment is only for testing the API and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. After testing this API in sandbox, you can start the process of moving to production.  ### Facility ID formats  A facility ID has the format prefix_stationNumber. The prefix is nca, vc, vba, or vha. Cemeteries may be VA national cemeteries or non-national; non-national cemeteries have the station number prefixed with an s. There are no other constraints on the format. Some facility ID examples are: - Health: `vha_402GA` - Benefits: `vba_539GB` - National cemetery: `nca_063` - Non-national cemetery: `nca_s1082` - Vet Center: `vc_0872MVC`   ### Mobile facilities  The mobile health facilities move regularly within a region. If a facility comes back from this API with \"mobile\": \"true\", the latitude/longitude and address could be inaccurate. To get the exact current location, please call the mobile facility number listed.
