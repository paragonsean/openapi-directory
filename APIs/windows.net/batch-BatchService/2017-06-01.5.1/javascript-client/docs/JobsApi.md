## jobAdd

> jobAdd(apiVersion, job, opts)

Adds a job to the specified account.

The Batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part of a job. In the first approach, the user specifies a Job Manager task. The Batch service launches this task when it is ready to start the job. The Job Manager task controls all other tasks that run under this job, by using the Task APIs. In the second approach, the user directly controls the execution of tasks under an active job, by using the Task APIs. Also note: when naming jobs, avoid including sensitive information such as user names or secret project names. This information may appear in telemetry logs accessible to Microsoft Support engineers.

### Example

```javascript
import BatchService from 'batch_service';

let apiInstance = new BatchService.JobsApi();
let apiVersion = "apiVersion_example"; // String | Client API Version.
let job = new BatchService.JobAddParameter(); // JobAddParameter | The job to be added.
let opts = {
  'timeout': 30, // Number | The maximum time that the server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is 30 seconds.
  'clientRequestId': "clientRequestId_example", // String | The caller-generated request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0.
  'returnClientRequestId': false, // Boolean | Whether the server should return the client-request-id in the response.
  'ocpDate': "ocpDate_example" // String | The time the request was issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly.
};
apiInstance.jobAdd(apiVersion, job, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully.');
  }
});
```

## jobDelete

> jobDelete(jobId, apiVersion, opts)

Deletes a job.

Deleting a job also deletes all tasks that are part of that job, and all job statistics. This also overrides the retention period for task data; that is, if the job contains tasks which are still retained on compute nodes, the Batch services deletes those tasks&#39; working directories and all their contents.  When a Delete Job request is received, the Batch service sets the job to the deleting state. All update operations on a job that is in deleting state will fail with status code 409 (Conflict), with additional information indicating that the job is being deleted.

### Example

```javascript
import BatchService from 'batch_service';

let apiInstance = new BatchService.JobsApi();
let jobId = "jobId_example"; // String | The ID of the job to delete.
let apiVersion = "apiVersion_example"; // String | Client API Version.
let opts = {
  'timeout': 30, // Number | The maximum time that the server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is 30 seconds.
  'clientRequestId': "clientRequestId_example", // String | The caller-generated request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0.
  'returnClientRequestId': false, // Boolean | Whether the server should return the client-request-id in the response.
  'ocpDate': "ocpDate_example", // String | The time the request was issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly.
  'ifMatch': "ifMatch_example", // String | An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service exactly matches the value specified by the client.
  'ifNoneMatch': "ifNoneMatch_example", // String | An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service does not match the value specified by the client.
  'ifModifiedSince': "ifModifiedSince_example", // String | A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has been modified since the specified time.
  'ifUnmodifiedSince': "ifUnmodifiedSince_example" // String | A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has not been modified since the specified time.
};
apiInstance.jobDelete(jobId, apiVersion, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully.');
  }
});

## jobDisable

> jobDisable(jobId, apiVersion, jobDisableParameter, opts)

Disables the specified job, preventing new tasks from running.

The Batch Service immediately moves the job to the disabling state. Batch then uses the disableTasks parameter to determine what to do with the currently running tasks of the job. The job remains in the disabling state until the disable operation is completed and all tasks have been dealt with according to the disableTasks option; the job then moves to the disabled state. No new tasks are started under the job until it moves back to active state. If you try to disable a job that is in any state other than active, disabling, or disabled, the request fails with status code 409.

### Example

```javascript
import BatchService from 'batch_service';

let apiInstance = new BatchService.JobsApi();
let jobId = "jobId_example"; // String | The ID of the job to disable.
let apiVersion = "apiVersion_example"; // String | Client API Version.
let jobDisableParameter = new BatchService.JobDisableParameter(); // JobDisableParameter | The parameters for the request.
let opts = {
  'timeout': 30, // Number | The maximum time that the server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is 30 seconds.
  'clientRequestId': "clientRequestId_example", // String | The caller-generated request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0.

## jobEnable

> jobEnable(jobId, apiVersion, opts)

Enables the specified job, allowing new tasks to run.

When you call this API, the Batch service sets a disabled job to the enabling state. After the this operation is completed, the job moves to the active state, and scheduling of new tasks under the job resumes. The Batch service does not allow a task to remain in the active state for more than 7 days. Therefore, if you enable a job containing active tasks which were added more than 7 days ago, those tasks will not run.

### Example

```javascript
import BatchService from 'batch_service';

let apiInstance = new BatchService.JobsApi();
let jobId = "jobId_example"; // String | The ID of the job to enable.
let apiVersion = "apiVersion_example"; // String | Client API Version.

## jobGetTaskCounts

> TaskCounts jobGetTaskCounts(jobId, apiVersion, opts)

Gets the task counts for the specified job.

Task counts provide a count of the tasks by active, running or completed task state, and a count of tasks which succeeded or failed. Tasks in the preparing state are counted as running.

## jobListPreparationAndReleaseTaskStatus

> CloudJobListPreparationAndReleaseTaskStatusResult jobListPreparationAndReleaseTaskStatus(jobId, apiVersion, opts)

Lists the execution status of the Job Preparation and Job Release task for the specified job across the compute nodes where the job has run.

This API returns the Job Preparation and Job Release task status on all compute nodes that have run the Job Preparation or Job Release task. This includes nodes which have since been removed from the pool. If this API is invoked on a job which has no Job Preparation or Job Release task, the Batch service returns HTTP status code 409 (Conflict) with an error code of JobPreparationTaskNotSpecified.

### Example

```javascript
import BatchService from 'batch_service';

let apiInstance = new BatchService.JobsApi();
let jobId = "jobId_example"; // String | The ID of the job.
let apiVersion = "apiVersion_example"; // String | Client API Version.
let opts = {
  'filter': "filter_example", // String | An OData $filter clause. To get the status of the Job Preparation and Job Release tasks on a specific compute node, use \"nodeId eq '{desired-node-id}'\"
  'select': "select_example", // String | An OData $select clause.
  'maxresults': 1000, // Number | The maximum number of items to return in the response. A maximum of 1000 tasks can be returned.

## jobTerminate

> jobTerminate(jobId, apiVersion, opts)

Terminates the specified job, marking it as completed.

```javascript
import BatchService from 'batch_service';

let apiInstance = new BatchService.JobsApi();
let jobId = "jobId_example"; // String | The ID of the job to terminate.
