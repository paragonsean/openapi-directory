 * Values are:   active - the job is available to have tasks scheduled.  disabling - a user has requested that the job be disabled, but the disable operation is still in progress (for example, waiting for tasks to terminate).  disabled - a user has disabled the job. No tasks are running, and no new tasks will be scheduled.  enabling - a user has requested that the job be enabled, but the enable operation is still in progress.  terminating - the job is about to complete, either because a Job Manager task has completed or because the user has terminated the job, but the terminate operation is still in progress (for example, because Job Release tasks are running).  completed - all tasks have terminated, and the system will not accept any more tasks or any further changes to the job.  deleting - a user has requested that the job be deleted, but the delete operation is still in progress (for example, because the system is still terminating running tasks).
