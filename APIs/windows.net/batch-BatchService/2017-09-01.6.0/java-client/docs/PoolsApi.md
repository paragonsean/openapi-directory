### Return type

null (empty response body)

### Authorization

No authorization required

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: application/json; odata=minimalmetadata
 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **201** | The request to the Batch service was successful. |  * ETag - The ETag HTTP response header. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the resource has changed between requests. In particular, you can pass the ETag to one of the If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match or If-None-Match headers. <br>  * client-request-id - The client-request-id provided by the client during the request. This will be returned only if the return-client-request-id parameter was set to true. <br>  * DataServiceId - The OData ID of the resource to which the request applied. <br>  * Last-Modified - The time at which the resource was last modified. <br>  * request-id - A unique identifier for the request that was made to the Batch service. If a request is consistently failing and you have verified that the request is properly formulated, you may use this value to report the error to Microsoft. In your report, include the value of this request ID, the approximate time that the request was made, the Batch account against which the request was made, and the region that account resides in. <br>  |
| **0** | The error from the Batch service. |  -  |

<a id="poolDelete"></a>
# **poolDelete**
> poolDelete(poolId, apiVersion, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Deletes a pool from the specified account.

When you request that a pool be deleted, the following actions occur: the pool state is set to deleting; any ongoing resize operation on the pool are stopped; the Batch service starts resizing the pool to zero nodes; any tasks running on existing nodes are terminated and requeued (as if a resize pool operation had been requested with the default requeue option); finally, the pool is removed from the system. Because running tasks are requeued, the user can rerun these tasks by updating their job to target a different pool. The tasks can then run on the new pool. If you want to override the requeue behavior, then you should call resize pool explicitly to shrink the pool to zero size before deleting the pool. If you call an Update, Patch or Delete API on a pool in the deleting state, it will fail with HTTP status code 409 with error code PoolBeingDeleted.

# **poolEnableAutoScale**
> poolEnableAutoScale(poolId, apiVersion, poolEnableAutoScaleParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Enables automatic scaling for a pool.

You cannot enable automatic scaling on a pool if a resize operation is in progress on the pool. If automatic scaling of the pool is currently disabled, you must specify a valid autoscale formula as part of the request. If automatic scaling of the pool is already enabled, you may specify a new autoscale formula and/or a new evaluation interval. You cannot call this API for the same pool more than once every 30 seconds.

# **poolEvaluateAutoScale**
> AutoScaleRun poolEvaluateAutoScale(poolId, apiVersion, poolEvaluateAutoScaleParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate)

Gets the result of evaluating an automatic scaling formula on the pool.

This API is primarily for validating an autoscale formula, as it simply returns the result without applying the formula to the pool. The pool must have auto scaling enabled in order to evaluate a formula.

    String poolId = "poolId_example"; // String | The ID of the pool on which to evaluate the automatic scaling formula.
    String apiVersion = "apiVersion_example"; // String | Client API Version.
    PoolEvaluateAutoScaleParameter poolEvaluateAutoScaleParameter = new PoolEvaluateAutoScaleParameter(); // PoolEvaluateAutoScaleParameter | The parameters for the request.
    Integer timeout = 30; // Integer | The maximum time that the server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is 30 seconds.
    UUID clientRequestId = UUID.randomUUID(); // UUID | The caller-generated request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0.
    Boolean returnClientRequestId = false; // Boolean | Whether the server should return the client-request-id in the response.
    String ocpDate = "ocpDate_example"; // String | The time the request was issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly.
    try {
      AutoScaleRun result = apiInstance.poolEvaluateAutoScale(poolId, apiVersion, poolEvaluateAutoScaleParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling PoolsApi#poolEvaluateAutoScale");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());

# **poolPatch**
> poolPatch(poolId, apiVersion, poolPatchParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Updates the properties of the specified pool.

This only replaces the pool properties specified in the request. For example, if the pool has a start task associated with it, and a request does not specify a start task element, then the pool keeps the existing start task.

<a id="poolResize"></a>
# **poolResize**
> poolResize(poolId, apiVersion, poolResizeParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Changes the number of compute nodes that are assigned to a pool.

You can only resize a pool when its allocation state is steady. If the pool is already resizing, the request fails with status code 409. When you resize a pool, the pool&#39;s allocation state changes from steady to resizing. You cannot resize pools which are configured for automatic scaling. If you try to do this, the Batch service returns an error 409. If you resize a pool downwards, the Batch service chooses which nodes to remove. To remove specific nodes, use the pool remove nodes API instead.

<a id="poolStopResize"></a>
# **poolStopResize**
> poolStopResize(poolId, apiVersion, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Stops an ongoing resize operation on the pool.

This does not restore the pool to its previous state before the resize operation: it only stops any further changes being made, and the pool maintains its current state. After stopping, the pool stabilizes at the number of nodes it was at when the stop operation was done. During the stop operation, the pool allocation state changes first to stopping and then to steady. A resize operation need not be an explicit resize pool request; this API can also be used to halt the initial sizing of the pool when it is created.

# **poolUpgradeOS**
> poolUpgradeOS(poolId, apiVersion, poolUpgradeOSParameter, timeout, clientRequestId, returnClientRequestId, ocpDate, ifMatch, ifNoneMatch, ifModifiedSince, ifUnmodifiedSince)

Upgrades the operating system of the specified pool.

During an upgrade, the Batch service upgrades each compute node in the pool. When a compute node is chosen for upgrade, any tasks running on that node are removed from the node and returned to the queue to be rerun later (or on a different compute node). The node will be unavailable until the upgrade is complete. This operation results in temporarily reduced pool capacity as nodes are taken out of service to be upgraded. Although the Batch service tries to avoid upgrading all compute nodes at the same time, it does not guarantee to do this (particularly on small pools); therefore, the pool may be temporarily unavailable to run tasks. When this operation runs, the pool state changes to upgrading. When all compute nodes have finished upgrading, the pool state returns to active. While the upgrade is in progress, the pool&#39;s currentOSVersion reflects the OS version that nodes are upgrading from, and targetOSVersion reflects the OS version that nodes are upgrading to. Once the upgrade is complete, currentOSVersion is updated to reflect the OS version now running on all nodes. This operation can only be invoked on pools created with the cloudServiceConfiguration property.

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **202** | The request to the Batch service was successful. |  * ETag - The ETag HTTP response header. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the resource has changed between requests. In particular, you can pass the ETag to one of the If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match or If-None-Match headers. <br>  * client-request-id - The client-request-id provided by the client during the request. This will be returned only if the return-client-request-id parameter was set to true. <br>  * DataServiceId - The OData ID of the resource to which the request applied. <br>  * Last-Modified - The time at which the resource was last modified. <br>  * request-id - A unique identifier for the request that was made to the Batch service. If a request is consistently failing and you have verified that the request is properly formulated, you may use this value to report the error to Microsoft. In your report, include the value of this request ID, the approximate time that the request was made, the Batch account against which the request was made, and the region that account resides in. <br>  |
| **0** | The error from the Batch service. |  -  |
