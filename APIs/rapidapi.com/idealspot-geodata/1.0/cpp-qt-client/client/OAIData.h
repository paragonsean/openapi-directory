 * Hyperlocal Demographics, Vehicle Traffic, Economic, Market Signals, and More. Use this API to request IdealSpot hyperlocal geospatial market insight and geometry data.   ## Detailed Description  Use this API as your **local economy microscope** by querying [IdealSpot](https://www.idealspot.com) hyperlocal market insight and geometry data. We offer the most precise, extensive, and frequently-updated local market data in the US. Our data is available across the entire US and can be queried at geographic scales ranging from the micro (Census block) through the macro (nation).  Better data and analysis leads to a better understanding of local market opportunities and risks.
