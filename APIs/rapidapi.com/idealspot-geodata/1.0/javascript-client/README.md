# ideal_spot_geo_data

IdealSpotGeoData - JavaScript client for ideal_spot_geo_data
Hyperlocal Demographics, Vehicle Traffic, Economic, Market Signals, and More. Use this API to request IdealSpot hyperlocal geospatial market insight and geometry data. 

## Detailed Description

Use this API as your **local economy microscope** by querying [IdealSpot](https://www.idealspot.com) hyperlocal market insight and geometry data. We offer the most precise, extensive, and frequently-updated local market data in the US. Our data is available across the entire US and can be queried at geographic scales ranging from the micro (Census block) through the macro (nation).

Better data and analysis leads to a better understanding of local market opportunities and risks. Integrate with your commercial real estate and marketing applications, machine learning workflows, and other investment analytics.

Our goal is to offer the most complete snapshot of the geographically distributed consumer and retail economy. We start with the fundamentals of consumers and business establishments. To connect retailers with consumers, we provide mobility data like vehicle traffic and mobile device data. To describe consumer intent, we provide geolocated digital marketing data. 

We believe that accurate capital allocation through reliable local market data is foundational to creating robust, healthy, and livable communities for all. We hope you and your clients find tremendous value in this service.

Mobile device visit counts, points of interest, brands | Fresh point of interest data across 3000+ brands, millions of POI, and historical foot traffic counts using mobile data for those points of interest
Origin/destination trips from mobile devices | Map origins and destinations of devices visiting an arbitrary catchment area
Competition search | Search all major point-of-interest aggregators in one query
Environment/climate | Expected weather patterns like temperature and precipitation
Filter search API | Query data for all counties in state, all tracts in MSA, etc
Road segment tiles | Plot road segments on maps in interactive applications

## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install ideal_spot_geo_data --save
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your ideal_spot_geo_data from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### git

If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var IdealSpotGeoData = require('ideal_spot_geo_data');


var api = new IdealSpotGeoData.GeometriesAPIApi()
var latitude = 3.4; // {Number} (Required) Search coordinate latitude
var longitude = 3.4; // {Number} (Required) Search coordinate longitude
var xRapidAPIKey = "xRapidAPIKey_example"; // {String} (Required) Rapid API Key. See https://rapidapi.com/idealspot-inc-idealspot-inc-default/api/idealspot-geodata
var xRapidAPIHost = "xRapidAPIHost_example"; // {String} 
var callback = function(error, data, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
};
api.fetchAdministrativeRegionsusingLatLng(latitude, longitude, xRapidAPIKey, xRapidAPIHost, callback);

```
