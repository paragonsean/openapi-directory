The API can be tested live in the interface below..<br>
* The <code>index</code> module provides access to constructors for all the classes which comprise the public API.
* <p>
* An AMD (recommended!) or CommonJS application will generally do something equivalent to the following:
* <pre>
* var HashlookupCirclApi = require('index'); // See note below*.
* var xxxSvc = new HashlookupCirclApi.XxxApi(); // Allocate the API class we're going to use.
* var yyyModel = new HashlookupCirclApi.Yyy(); // Construct a model instance.
* yyyModel.someProperty = 'someValue';
* ...
* var zzz = xxxSvc.doSomething(yyyModel); // Invoke the service.
* ...
* </pre>
* <em>*NOTE: For a top-level AMD script, use require(['index'], function(){...})
* and put the application logic within the callback function.</em>
* </p>
* <p>
* A non-AMD browser application (discouraged) might do something like this:
* <pre>
* var xxxSvc = new HashlookupCirclApi.XxxApi(); // Allocate the API class we're going to use.
* var yyy = new HashlookupCirclApi.Yyy(); // Construct a model instance.
* yyyModel.someProperty = 'someValue';
* ...
* var zzz = xxxSvc.doSomething(yyyModel); // Invoke the service.
* ...
* </pre>
