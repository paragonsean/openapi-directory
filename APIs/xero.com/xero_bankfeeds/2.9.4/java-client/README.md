## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:
1. Java 1.8+
2. Maven (3.8.3+)/Gradle (7.2+)

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

### Maven users

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId>
  <artifactId>openapi-java-client</artifactId>
  <version>2.9.4</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()     // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to maven central.
    mavenLocal()       // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to the local maven repo.
  }

  dependencies {
     implementation "org.openapitools:openapi-java-client:2.9.4"
  }
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

* `target/openapi-java-client-2.9.4.jar`
* `target/lib/*.jar`

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.auth.*;
import org.openapitools.client.model.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.BankFeedsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://api.xero.com/bankfeeds.xro/1.0");
    
    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: OAuth2
    OAuth OAuth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("OAuth2");
    OAuth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    BankFeedsApi apiInstance = new BankFeedsApi(defaultClient);
    String xeroTenantId = "xeroTenantId_example"; // String | Xero identifier for Tenant
    FeedConnections feedConnections = new FeedConnections(); // FeedConnections | Feed Connection(s) array object in the body
    try {
      FeedConnections result = apiInstance.createFeedConnections(xeroTenantId, feedConnections);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling BankFeedsApi#createFeedConnections");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

```
