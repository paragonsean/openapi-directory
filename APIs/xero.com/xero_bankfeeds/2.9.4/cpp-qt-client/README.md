Xero Bank Feeds API

- API version: 2.9.4
- Generator version: 7.9.0

The Bank Feeds API is a closed API that is only available to financial institutions that have an established financial services partnership with Xero. If you're an existing financial services partner that wants access, contact your local Partner Manager. If you're a financial institution who wants to provide bank feeds to your business customers, contact us to become a financial services partner.

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:

1. CMake 3.2+
2. Qt
3. C++ Compiler

## Getting Started

example.h:
```c++

#include <iostream>
#include "../client/OAIBankFeedsApi.h"

using namespace test_namespace;

class Example : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT
    QString create();
    OAIFeedConnections create();
public Q_SLOTS:
   void exampleFunction1();
};

```

example.cpp:
```c++

#include "../client/OAIBankFeedsApi.h"
#include "example.h"
#include <QTimer>
#include <QEventLoop>

QString Example::create(){
    QString obj;
OAIFeedConnections Example::create(){
    OAIFeedConnections obj;
 return obj;
}

void Example::exampleFunction1(){
     OAIBankFeedsApi apiInstance;
     
      //OAuth Authentication supported right now

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIBankFeedsApi::createFeedConnectionsSignal, [&]() {
          loop.quit();
      });
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIBankFeedsApi::createFeedConnectionsSignalE, [&](QNetworkReply::NetworkError, QString error_str) {
          qDebug() << "Error happened while issuing request : " << error_str;
          loop.quit();
      });

      QString xero_tenant_id = create(); // QString | Xero identifier for Tenant

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIBankFeedsApi::createFeedConnectionsSignal, [&]() {
          loop.quit();
      });
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIBankFeedsApi::createFeedConnectionsSignalE, [&](QNetworkReply::NetworkError, QString error_str) {
          qDebug() << "Error happened while issuing request : " << error_str;
          loop.quit();
      });

      OAIFeedConnections oai_feed_connections = create(); // OAIFeedConnections | Feed Connection(s) array object in the body
      apiInstance.createFeedConnections(xero_tenant_idoai_feed_connections);
      QTimer::singleShot(5000, &loop, &QEventLoop::quit);
      loop.exec();
  }

```

## Documentation for Servers

Parameterized Servers are supported. Define a server in the API for each endpoint with arbitrary numbers of variables:

```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:{port}/{basePath}
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
    port:
      enum:
        - '3000'
        - '1000'
      default: '3000'
    basePath:
      default: v1
```
To change the default variable, use this function in each Api:
```c++
int setDefaultServerValue(int serverIndex,const QString &operation, const QString &variable,const QString &val);
```
The parameter "serverIndex" will choose a server from the server list for each endpoint. There is always at least one server with index 0. The Parameter "operation" should be the desired endpoint operationid.
Variable is the name of the variable you wish to change and the value is the new default Value.
The function will return -1 when the variable does not exists, -2 if value is not defined in the variable enum and -3 if the operation is not found.

If your endpoint has multiple server objects in the servers array, you can set the server that will be used with this function:
```c++
void setServerIndex(const QString &operation, int serverIndex);
```
Parameter "operation" should be your operationid. "serverIndex" is the index you want to set as your default server. The function will check if there is a server with your index.
Here is an example of multiple servers in the servers array. The first server will have index 0 and the second will have index 1.
```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:8080/
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
- url: https://localhost:8080/v1
```
