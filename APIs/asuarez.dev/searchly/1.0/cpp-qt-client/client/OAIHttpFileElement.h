/**
 * SearchLy API v1
 * # Introduction The SearchLy API provides similarity searching based on song lyrics.  # Operations The API allows for the `/similarity/by_song` operation, which allows clients to search the similarity for an existing song in the database. Also, the API has an additional `/similarity/by_content` endpoint which allows clients to search similarity given a free String input through a JSON request body. Additional `/song/search` operation is available for searching songs given a query String.  # Endpoint The API endpoint for the SearchLy API v1 is as follows: ``` https://searchly.asuarez.dev/api/v1 ```  # Motivation This project was built in order to create an API for searching similarities based on song lyrics. There are a lot of songs in the industry and most of them are talking about the same topic. What I wanted to prove with SearchLy was to estimate how similar are two songs between them based on the meaning of their lyrics.  SearchLy is using a database of 100k songs from AZLyrics, using [this scraper](https://github.com/AlbertSuarez/azlyrics-scraper), which is being updated periodically. Then, using word2vec and NMSLIB, it was possible to create an index where you can search similarities using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.  > **Note**: I am currently using a micro-instance from DigitalOcean where the API is deployed, so you should expect a bad performance. However, if this API becomes popular I will deploy it in a bigger instance.
