/*
 * Severa Public Rest API Documentation
 * The API uses OAuth2 client creadentials flow. To get the Bearer token for the resources you have to request the token by using route '/token', found from Authentication controller.    You need to provide a Client_Id, client_secret and scope needed. The client_id and client_secret can be obtained from Severa UI Rest Api settings section.    After authentication, calls need to use the Bearer token as authorization header (Bearer {accessToken}). The calls also need to have Client_Id header.    The access token can be refreshed from '/refreshtoken' route using the refresh token which was obtained from the authentication.
