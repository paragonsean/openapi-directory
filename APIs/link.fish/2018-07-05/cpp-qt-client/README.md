# C++ Qt API client

# 

link.fish API

- API version: 2018-07-05
- Generator version: 7.9.0

API to easily extract data from websites.


# Base URL


All URLs referenced in the documentation have the following base:


```
https://api.link.fish
```


The REST API is only served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.


# Authentication
HTTP requests to the REST API are protected with [HTTP Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). You will use the email address of your link.fish account as the username and your API access token as the password for HTTP Basic authentication.

If you do not have an account yet, go to [https://link.fish/api](https://link.fish/api) and create one first.

You will receive the API access token automatically via email after you signed up. To generate a new token and invalidate the current one log into your link.fish  account at [https://app.link.fish](https://app.link.fish) and go to: \"Plugins\" -> \"API Dashboard\"

There you can also see how many credits you used already.


# Errors
The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:
```
{

  \"status\": {HTTP STATUS CODE}
  \"message\": \"{ERROR MESSAGE}\"
}
```
Like for example when the authorization is not provided or wrong:
```
{

  \"status\": 401
  \"message\": \"Unauthorized\"
}
```

# Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find it in the response headers, under X-LF-Request-Id. In case you have problems please provide this identifier that we can help you as good and fast as possible.


Example:
```
X-LF-Request-Id: f7f0036f-5277-421a-b143-f7a151571d18
```


# Item format

The data is by default deeply nested. So if it should be checked if there is an offer with a price, the whole tree has to be checked. To make that simpler, it is also possible to return the data \"flat\". If selected it will flatten the tree by copying all the data to the main level under a property with the name of its type and link the data internally.

Information: We created a node module which allows converting between the two formats. It did not get open sourced yet. If you are in need, simply contact us via api@link.fish.


# Response Content Type
By default, all data gets returned as JSON. If the data should be returned as XML add the following header:

```
Accept: application/xml
```

# Credits

Depending on the request made a different amount of credits get charged. How many which request costs can be found on the [API pricing page](http://link.fish/api/#pricing). Additionally, does a  header named \"X-LF-Credits-Charged\" get added to each successful response with information about the credits.

Example:
```
X-LF-Credits-Charged: 1 # Credits used for current requests
X-LF-Credits-Subscription-Max: 1000 # Total credits available in subscription
X-LF-Credits-Subscription-Used: 512 # Credits still left in current month
```
You can check anytime how many credits you did use already by logging into your link.fish  account at [https://app.link.fish](https://app.link.fish) and checking under:  \"Plugins\" -> \"API Dashboard\"

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:

1. CMake 3.2+
2. Qt
3. C++ Compiler

## Getting Started

example.h:
```c++

#include <iostream>
#include "../client/OAIRESTEndpointsApi.h"

using namespace test_namespace;

class Example : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT
    QString create();
    bool create();
    bool create();
public Q_SLOTS:
   void exampleFunction1();
};

```

example.cpp:
```c++

#include "../client/OAIRESTEndpointsApi.h"
#include "example.h"
#include <QTimer>
#include <QEventLoop>

QString Example::create(){
    QString obj;
bool Example::create(){
    bool obj;
bool Example::create(){
    bool obj;
 return obj;
}

void Example::exampleFunction1(){
     OAIRESTEndpointsApi apiInstance;
     
      // Configure HTTP basic authorization: basicAuth
      apiInstance.setUsername("YOUR USERNAME");
      apiInstance.setPassword("YOUR PASSWORD");

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIRESTEndpointsApi::urlsAppsGetSignal, [&]() {
          loop.quit();
      });
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIRESTEndpointsApi::urlsAppsGetSignalE, [&](QNetworkReply::NetworkError, QString error_str) {
          qDebug() << "Error happened while issuing request : " << error_str;
          loop.quit();
      });

      QString url = create(); // QString | The URL of the website to query

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIRESTEndpointsApi::urlsAppsGetSignal, [&]() {
          loop.quit();
      });
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIRESTEndpointsApi::urlsAppsGetSignalE, [&](QNetworkReply::NetworkError, QString error_str) {
          qDebug() << "Error happened while issuing request : " << error_str;
          loop.quit();
      });

      bool return_urls = create(); // bool | Returns app URLs instead of the identifiers

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIRESTEndpointsApi::urlsAppsGetSignal, [&]() {
          loop.quit();
      });
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIRESTEndpointsApi::urlsAppsGetSignalE, [&](QNetworkReply::NetworkError, QString error_str) {
          qDebug() << "Error happened while issuing request : " << error_str;
          loop.quit();
      });

      bool browser_render = create(); // bool | If the page should be fully rendered with a browser to extract data. The request will then cost 5 credits instead of 1!
      apiInstance.urlsAppsGet(urlreturn_urlsbrowser_render);
      QTimer::singleShot(5000, &loop, &QEventLoop::quit);
      loop.exec();
  }

```

## Documentation for Servers

Parameterized Servers are supported. Define a server in the API for each endpoint with arbitrary numbers of variables:

```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:{port}/{basePath}
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
    port:
      enum:
        - '3000'
        - '1000'
      default: '3000'
    basePath:
      default: v1
```
To change the default variable, use this function in each Api:
```c++
int setDefaultServerValue(int serverIndex,const QString &operation, const QString &variable,const QString &val);
```
The parameter "serverIndex" will choose a server from the server list for each endpoint. There is always at least one server with index 0. The Parameter "operation" should be the desired endpoint operationid.
Variable is the name of the variable you wish to change and the value is the new default Value.
The function will return -1 when the variable does not exists, -2 if value is not defined in the variable enum and -3 if the operation is not found.

If your endpoint has multiple server objects in the servers array, you can set the server that will be used with this function:
```c++
void setServerIndex(const QString &operation, int serverIndex);
```
Parameter "operation" should be your operationid. "serverIndex" is the index you want to set as your default server. The function will check if there is a server with your index.
Here is an example of multiple servers in the servers array. The first server will have index 0 and the second will have index 1.
```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:8080/
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
- url: https://localhost:8080/v1
```
