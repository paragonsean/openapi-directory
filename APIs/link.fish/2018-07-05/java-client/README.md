link.fish API
- API version: 2018-07-05
  - Build date: 2024-10-12T12:31:49.001045-04:00[America/New_York]
  - Generator version: 7.9.0

API to easily extract data from websites.


# Base URL


All URLs referenced in the documentation have the following base:


```
https://api.link.fish
```


The REST API is only served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.


# Authentication
HTTP requests to the REST API are protected with [HTTP Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). You will use the email address of your link.fish account as the username and your API access token as the password for HTTP Basic authentication.

If you do not have an account yet, go to [https://link.fish/api](https://link.fish/api) and create one first.

You will receive the API access token automatically via email after you signed up. To generate a new token and invalidate the current one log into your link.fish  account at [https://app.link.fish](https://app.link.fish) and go to: \"Plugins\" -> \"API Dashboard\"

There you can also see how many credits you used already.


# Errors
The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:
```
{

  \"status\": {HTTP STATUS CODE}
  \"message\": \"{ERROR MESSAGE}\"
}
```
Like for example when the authorization is not provided or wrong:
```
{

  \"status\": 401
  \"message\": \"Unauthorized\"
}
```

# Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find it in the response headers, under X-LF-Request-Id. In case you have problems please provide this identifier that we can help you as good and fast as possible.


Example:
```
X-LF-Request-Id: f7f0036f-5277-421a-b143-f7a151571d18
```


# Item format

The data is by default deeply nested. So if it should be checked if there is an offer with a price, the whole tree has to be checked. To make that simpler, it is also possible to return the data \"flat\". If selected it will flatten the tree by copying all the data to the main level under a property with the name of its type and link the data internally.

Information: We created a node module which allows converting between the two formats. It did not get open sourced yet. If you are in need, simply contact us via api@link.fish.


# Response Content Type
By default, all data gets returned as JSON. If the data should be returned as XML add the following header:

```
Accept: application/xml
```

# Credits

Depending on the request made a different amount of credits get charged. How many which request costs can be found on the [API pricing page](http://link.fish/api/#pricing). Additionally, does a  header named \"X-LF-Credits-Charged\" get added to each successful response with information about the credits.

Example:
```
X-LF-Credits-Charged: 1 # Credits used for current requests
X-LF-Credits-Subscription-Max: 1000 # Total credits available in subscription
X-LF-Credits-Subscription-Used: 512 # Credits still left in current month
```
You can check anytime how many credits you did use already by logging into your link.fish  account at [https://app.link.fish](https://app.link.fish) and checking under:  \"Plugins\" -> \"API Dashboard\"

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:
1. Java 1.8+
2. Maven (3.8.3+)/Gradle (7.2+)

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

### Maven users

Add this dependency to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId>
  <artifactId>openapi-java-client</artifactId>
  <version>2018-07-05</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()     // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to maven central.
    mavenLocal()       // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to the local maven repo.
  }

  dependencies {
     implementation "org.openapitools:openapi-java-client:2018-07-05"
  }
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

* `target/openapi-java-client-2018-07-05.jar`
* `target/lib/*.jar`

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.auth.*;
import org.openapitools.client.model.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.RestEndpointsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://api.link.fish");
    
    // Configure HTTP basic authorization: basicAuth
    HttpBasicAuth basicAuth = (HttpBasicAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("basicAuth");
    basicAuth.setUsername("YOUR USERNAME");
    basicAuth.setPassword("YOUR PASSWORD");

    RestEndpointsApi apiInstance = new RestEndpointsApi(defaultClient);
    String url = "url_example"; // String | The URL of the website to query
    Boolean returnUrls = false; // Boolean | Returns app URLs instead of the identifiers
    Boolean browserRender = false; // Boolean | If the page should be fully rendered with a browser to extract data. The request will then cost 5 credits instead of 1!
    try {
      Apps result = apiInstance.urlsAppsGet(url, returnUrls, browserRender);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling RestEndpointsApi#urlsAppsGet");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

```

### basicAuth

- **Type**: HTTP basic authentication


## Recommendation

It's recommended to create an instance of `ApiClient` per thread in a multithreaded environment to avoid any potential issues.
