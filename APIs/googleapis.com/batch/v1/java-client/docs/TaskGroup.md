# TaskGroup

A TaskGroup defines one or more Tasks that all share the same TaskSpec.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**name** | **String** | Output only. TaskGroup name. The system generates this field based on parent Job name. For example: \&quot;projects/123456/locations/us-west1/jobs/job01/taskGroups/group01\&quot;. |  [optional] [readonly] |
|**parallelism** | **String** | Max number of tasks that can run in parallel. Default to min(task_count, parallel tasks per job limit). See: [Job Limits](https://cloud.google.com/batch/quotas#job_limits). Field parallelism must be 1 if the scheduling_policy is IN_ORDER. |  [optional] |
|**permissiveSsh** | **Boolean** | When true, Batch will configure SSH to allow passwordless login between VMs running the Batch tasks in the same TaskGroup. |  [optional] |
|**requireHostsFile** | **Boolean** | When true, Batch will populate a file with a list of all VMs assigned to the TaskGroup and set the BATCH_HOSTS_FILE environment variable to the path of that file. Defaults to false. The host file supports up to 1000 VMs. |  [optional] |
|**runAsNonRoot** | **Boolean** | Optional. If not set or set to false, Batch uses the root user to execute runnables. If set to true, Batch runs the runnables using a non-root user. Currently, the non-root user Batch used is generated by OS Login. For more information, see [About OS Login](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/oslogin). |  [optional] |
|**schedulingPolicy** | [**SchedulingPolicyEnum**](#SchedulingPolicyEnum) | Scheduling policy for Tasks in the TaskGroup. The default value is AS_SOON_AS_POSSIBLE. |  [optional] |
|**taskCount** | **String** | Number of Tasks in the TaskGroup. Default is 1. |  [optional] |
|**taskCountPerNode** | **String** | Max number of tasks that can be run on a VM at the same time. If not specified, the system will decide a value based on available compute resources on a VM and task requirements. |  [optional] |
|**taskEnvironments** | [**List&lt;Environment&gt;**](Environment.md) | An array of environment variable mappings, which are passed to Tasks with matching indices. If task_environments is used then task_count should not be specified in the request (and will be ignored). Task count will be the length of task_environments. Tasks get a BATCH_TASK_INDEX and BATCH_TASK_COUNT environment variable, in addition to any environment variables set in task_environments, specifying the number of Tasks in the Task&#39;s parent TaskGroup, and the specific Task&#39;s index in the TaskGroup (0 through BATCH_TASK_COUNT - 1). |  [optional] |
|**taskSpec** | [**TaskSpec**](TaskSpec.md) |  |  [optional] |
