## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**hash** | **String** | A string-encoded hash (eg \&quot;1a2b3c\&quot;, not the byte array [0x1a, 0x2b, 0x3c]) using an implementation-defined hash algorithm (eg SHA-256). | [optional] 
**sizeBytes** | **String** | The size of the contents. While this is not strictly required as part of an identifier (after all, any given hash will have exactly one canonical size), it&#39;s useful in almost all cases when one might want to send or retrieve blobs of content and is included here for this reason. | [optional]
