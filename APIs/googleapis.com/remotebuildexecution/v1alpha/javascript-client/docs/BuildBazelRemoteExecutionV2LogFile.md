## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**digest** | [**BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Digest**](BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Digest.md) |  | [optional] 
**humanReadable** | **Boolean** | This is a hint as to the purpose of the log, and is set to true if the log is human-readable text that can be usefully displayed to a user, and false otherwise. For instance, if a command-line client wishes to print the server logs to the terminal for a failed action, this allows it to avoid displaying a binary file. | [optional]
