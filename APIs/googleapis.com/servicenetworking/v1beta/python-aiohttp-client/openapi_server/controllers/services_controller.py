    For service producers, provisions a new subnet in a peered service&#39;s shared VPC network in the requested region and with the requested size that&#39;s expressed as a CIDR range (number of leading bits of ipV4 network mask). The method checks against the assigned allocated ranges to find a non-conflicting IP address range. The method will reuse a subnet if subsequent calls contain the same subnet name, region, and prefix length. This method will make producer&#39;s tenant project to be a shared VPC service project as needed.
