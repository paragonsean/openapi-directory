     * Constructs a new <code>PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition</code>.
     * A condition type that allows alert policies to be defined using Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) (https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).The PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition message contains information from a Prometheus alerting rule and its associated rule group.A Prometheus alerting rule is described here (https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/). The semantics of a Prometheus alerting rule is described here (https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/#rule).A Prometheus rule group is described here (https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/). The semantics of a Prometheus rule group is described here (https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/#rule_group).Because Cloud Alerting has no representation of a Prometheus rule group resource, we must embed the information of the parent rule group inside each of the conditions that refer to it. We must also update the contents of all Prometheus alerts in case the information of their rule group changes.The PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition protocol buffer combines the information of the corresponding rule group and alerting rule. The structure of the PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition protocol buffer does NOT mimic the structure of the Prometheus rule group and alerting rule YAML declarations. The PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition protocol buffer may change in the future to support future rule group and/or alerting rule features. There are no new such features at the present time (2023-06-26).
