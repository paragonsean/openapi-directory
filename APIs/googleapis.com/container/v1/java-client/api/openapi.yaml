        \ of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool temporarily for the\

        \ + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many nodes are being\
        \ upgraded at the same time). Note: upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption\
        \ since workloads need to be moved from old nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even\
        \ if maxUnavailable=0, this holds true. (Disruption stays within the limits\
        \ of PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.) Consider a hypothetical node\
        \ pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2, maxUnavailable=1. This means the upgrade\
        \ process upgrades 3 nodes simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded)\
        \ nodes, then it brings down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at the same time.\
        \ This ensures that there are always at least 4 nodes available. These upgrade\
        \ settings configure the upgrade strategy for the node pool. Use strategy\

        \ is ROLLING, use max_surge and max_unavailable to control the level of parallelism\
        \ and the level of disruption caused by upgrade. 1. maxSurge controls the\
        \ number of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool temporarily\
        \ for the time of the upgrade to increase the number of available nodes. 2.\
