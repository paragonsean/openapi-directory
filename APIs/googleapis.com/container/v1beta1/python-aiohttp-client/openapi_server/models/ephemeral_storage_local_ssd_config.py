        Number of local SSDs to use to back ephemeral storage. Uses NVMe interfaces. A zero (or unset) value has different meanings depending on machine type being used: 1. For pre-Gen3 machines, which support flexible numbers of local ssds, zero (or unset) means to disable using local SSDs as ephemeral storage. The limit for this value is dependent upon the maximum number of disk available on a machine per zone. See: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for more information. 2.
