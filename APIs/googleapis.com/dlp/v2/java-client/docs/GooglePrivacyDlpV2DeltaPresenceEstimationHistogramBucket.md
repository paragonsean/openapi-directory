A DeltaPresenceEstimationHistogramBucket message with the following values: min_probability: 0.1 max_probability: 0.2 frequency: 42 means that there are 42 records for which Î´ is in [0.1, 0.2). An important particular case is when min_probability = max_probability = 1: then, every individual who shares this quasi-identifier combination is in the dataset.
