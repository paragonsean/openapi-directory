# CloudIdentityApi.CheckTransitiveMembershipResponse

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**hasMembership** | **Boolean** | Response does not include the possible roles of a member since the behavior of this rpc is not all-or-nothing unlike the other rpcs. So, it may not be possible to list all the roles definitively, due to possible lack of authorization in some of the paths. | [optional]
