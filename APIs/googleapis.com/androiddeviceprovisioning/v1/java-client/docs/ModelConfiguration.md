# ModelConfiguration

A configuration collects the provisioning options for Android devices. Each configuration combines the following: * The EMM device policy controller (DPC) installed on the devices. * EMM policies enforced on the devices. * Metadata displayed on the device to help users during setup. Customers can add as many configurations as they need. However, zero-touch enrollment works best when a customer sets a default configuration that's applied to any new devices the organization purchases.
