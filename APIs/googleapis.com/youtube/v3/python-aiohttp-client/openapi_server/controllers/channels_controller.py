    Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.

    :param part: The *part* parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more channel resource properties that the API response will include. If the parameter identifies a property that contains child properties, the child properties will be included in the response. For example, in a channel resource, the contentDetails property contains other properties, such as the uploads properties. As such, if you set *part&#x3D;contentDetails*, the API response will also contain all of those nested properties.
    :type part: List[str]
    :param xgafv: V1 error format.
    :type xgafv: str

    :param key: API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    :type key: str
    :param oauth_token: OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    :type oauth_token: str
    :param pretty_print: Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    :type pretty_print: bool
    :param quota_user: Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.
    :type quota_user: str
    :param upload_protocol: Upload protocol for media (e.g. \&quot;raw\&quot;, \&quot;multipart\&quot;).

    :param for_handle: Return the channel associated with a YouTube handle.
    :type for_handle: str
    :param for_username: Return the channel associated with a YouTube username.
    :type for_username: str
    :param hl: Stands for \&quot;host language\&quot;. Specifies the localization language of the metadata to be filled into snippet.localized. The field is filled with the default metadata if there is no localization in the specified language. The parameter value must be a language code included in the list returned by the i18nLanguages.list method (e.g. en_US, es_MX).
    :type hl: str
    :param id: Return the channels with the specified IDs.

    :type mine: bool
    :param my_subscribers: Return the channels subscribed to the authenticated user
    :type my_subscribers: bool
    :param on_behalf_of_content_owner: *Note:* This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners. The *onBehalfOfContentOwner* parameter indicates that the request&#39;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
    :type on_behalf_of_content_owner: str
    :param page_token: The *pageToken* parameter identifies a specific page in the result set that should be returned. In an API response, the nextPageToken and prevPageToken properties identify other pages that could be retrieved.

    :param part: The *part* parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include.
