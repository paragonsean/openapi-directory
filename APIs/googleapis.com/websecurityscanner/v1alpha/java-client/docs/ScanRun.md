## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**endTime** | **String** | The time at which the ScanRun reached termination state - that the ScanRun is either finished or stopped by user. |  [optional] |

|**hasVulnerabilities** | **Boolean** | Whether the scan run has found any vulnerabilities. |  [optional] |
|**name** | **String** | The resource name of the ScanRun. The name follows the format of &#39;projects/{projectId}/scanConfigs/{scanConfigId}/scanRuns/{scanRunId}&#39;. The ScanRun IDs are generated by the system. |  [optional] |
|**progressPercent** | **Integer** | The percentage of total completion ranging from 0 to 100. If the scan is in queue, the value is 0. If the scan is running, the value ranges from 0 to 100. If the scan is finished, the value is 100. |  [optional] |
|**resultState** | [**ResultStateEnum**](#ResultStateEnum) | The result state of the ScanRun. This field is only available after the execution state reaches \&quot;FINISHED\&quot;. |  [optional] |

|**urlsTestedCount** | **String** | The number of URLs tested during this ScanRun. If the scan is in progress, the value represents the number of URLs tested up to now.
