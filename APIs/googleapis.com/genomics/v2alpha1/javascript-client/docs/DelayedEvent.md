# GenomicsApi.DelayedEvent

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**cause** | **String** | A textual description of the cause of the delay. The string can change without notice because it is often generated by another service (such as Compute Engine). | [optional] 
**metrics** | **[String]** | If the delay was caused by a resource shortage, this field lists the Compute Engine metrics that are preventing this operation from running (for example, &#x60;CPUS&#x60; or &#x60;INSTANCES&#x60;). If the particular metric is not known, a single &#x60;UNKNOWN&#x60; metric will be present. | [optional]
