# my_business_business_calls_api

MyBusinessBusinessCallsApi - JavaScript client for my_business_business_calls_api
The My Business Business Calls API manages business calls information of a location on Google and collect insights like the number of missed calls to their location. Additional information about Business calls can be found at https://support.google.com/business/answer/9688285?p=call_history. If the Google Business Profile links to a Google Ads account and call history is turned on, calls that last longer than a specific time, and that can be attributed to an ad interaction, will show in the linked Google Ads account under the \"Calls from Ads\" conversion. If smart bidding and call conversions are used in the optimization strategy, there could be a change in ad spend. Learn more about smart bidding. To view and perform actions on a location's calls, you need to be a `OWNER`, `CO_OWNER` or `MANAGER` of the location. Note - If you have a quota of 0 after enabling the API, please request for GBP API access.

## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install my_business_business_calls_api --save
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your my_business_business_calls_api from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### git

If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var MyBusinessBusinessCallsApi = require('my_business_business_calls_api');


var api = new MyBusinessBusinessCallsApi.LocationsApi()
var parent = "parent_example"; // {String} Required. The parent location to fetch calls insights for. Format: locations/{location_id}
var opts = {
  'xgafv': "xgafv_example", // {String} V1 error format.
  'accessToken': "accessToken_example", // {String} OAuth access token.
  'alt': "alt_example", // {String} Data format for response.
  'callback': "callback_example", // {String} JSONP
  'fields': "fields_example", // {String} Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
  'key': "key_example", // {String} API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
  'oauthToken': "oauthToken_example", // {String} OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
  'prettyPrint': true, // {Boolean} Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
  'quotaUser': "quotaUser_example", // {String} Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.
  'uploadProtocol': "uploadProtocol_example", // {String} Upload protocol for media (e.g. \"raw\", \"multipart\").
  'uploadType': "uploadType_example", // {String} Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. \"media\", \"multipart\").
  'filter': "filter_example", // {String} Optional. A filter constraining the calls insights to return. The response includes only entries that match the filter. If the MetricType is not provided, AGGREGATE_COUNT is returned. If no end_date is provided, the last date for which data is available is used. If no start_date is provided, we will default to the first date for which data is available, which is currently 6 months. If start_date is before the date when data is available, data is returned starting from the date when it is available. At this time we support following filters. 1. start_date=\"DATE\" where date is in YYYY-MM-DD format. 2. end_date=\"DATE\" where date is in YYYY-MM-DD format. 3. metric_type=XYZ where XYZ is a valid MetricType. 4. Conjunctions(AND) of all of the above. e.g., \"start_date=2021-08-01 AND end_date=2021-08-10 AND metric_type=AGGREGATE_COUNT\" The AGGREGATE_COUNT metric_type ignores the DD part of the date.
  'pageSize': 56, // {Number} Optional. The maximum number of BusinessCallsInsights to return. If unspecified, at most 20 will be returned. Some of the metric_types(e.g, AGGREGATE_COUNT) returns a single page. For these metrics, the page_size is ignored.
  'pageToken': "pageToken_example" // {String} Optional. A page token, received from a previous `ListBusinessCallsInsights` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListBusinessCallsInsights` must match the call that provided the page token. Some of the metric_types (e.g, AGGREGATE_COUNT) returns a single page. For these metrics, the pake_token is ignored.
};
var callback = function(error, data, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
};
api.mybusinessbusinesscallsLocationsBusinesscallsinsightsList(parent, opts, callback);

```
