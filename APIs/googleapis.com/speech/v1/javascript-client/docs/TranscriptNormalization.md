**entries** | [**[Entry]**](Entry.md) | A list of replacement entries. We will perform replacement with one entry at a time. For example, the second entry in [\&quot;cat\&quot; &#x3D;&gt; \&quot;dog\&quot;, \&quot;mountain cat\&quot; &#x3D;&gt; \&quot;mountain dog\&quot;] will never be applied because we will always process the first entry before it. At most 100 entries. | [optional]
