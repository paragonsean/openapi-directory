## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**byproducts** | [**ByProducts**](ByProducts.md) |  | [optional] 
**command** | **[String]** | This field contains the full command executed for the step. This can also be empty if links are generated for operations that aren&#39;t directly mapped to a specific command. Each term in the command is an independent string in the list. An example of a command in the in-toto metadata field is: \&quot;command\&quot;: [\&quot;git\&quot;, \&quot;clone\&quot;, \&quot;https://github.com/in-toto/demo-project.git\&quot;] | [optional] 
**environment** | [**Environment**](Environment.md) |  | [optional] 
**materials** | [**[GrafeasV1beta1IntotoArtifact]**](GrafeasV1beta1IntotoArtifact.md) | Materials are the supply chain artifacts that go into the step and are used for the operation performed. The key of the map is the path of the artifact and the structure contains the recorded hash information. An example is: \&quot;materials\&quot;: [ { \&quot;resource_uri\&quot;: \&quot;foo/bar\&quot;, \&quot;hashes\&quot;: { \&quot;sha256\&quot;: \&quot;ebebf...\&quot;, : } } ] | [optional] 
**products** | [**[GrafeasV1beta1IntotoArtifact]**](GrafeasV1beta1IntotoArtifact.md) | Products are the supply chain artifacts generated as a result of the step. The structure is identical to that of materials. | [optional]
