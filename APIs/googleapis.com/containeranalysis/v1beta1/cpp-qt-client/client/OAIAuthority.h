In addition, the Container Analysis API is an implementation of the Grafeas API, which enables storing, querying, and retrieval of critical metadata about all of your software artifacts.

/*
 * OAIAuthority.h
 *
 * Note kind that represents a logical attestation \&quot;role\&quot; or \&quot;authority\&quot;. For example, an organization might have one &#x60;Authority&#x60; for \&quot;QA\&quot; and one for \&quot;build\&quot;. This note is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for the attached occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle to attach an occurrence to a given note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached attestation occurrences, even if they don&#39;t all live in the same project.
