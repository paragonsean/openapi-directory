| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**value** | **Double** | Specify a threshold value that can trigger the alert. If this threshold config is for feature distribution distance: 1. For categorical feature, the distribution distance is calculated by L-inifinity norm. 2. For numerical feature, the distribution distance is calculated by Jensenâ€“Shannon divergence. Each feature must have a non-zero threshold if they need to be monitored. Otherwise no alert will be triggered for that feature. |  [optional] |
