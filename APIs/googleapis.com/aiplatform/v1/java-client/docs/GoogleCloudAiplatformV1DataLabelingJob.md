|**labelerCount** | **Integer** | Required. Number of labelers to work on each DataItem. |  [optional] |
|**labelingProgress** | **Integer** | Output only. Current labeling job progress percentage scaled in interval [0, 100], indicating the percentage of DataItems that has been finished. |  [optional] [readonly] |
|**labels** | **Map&lt;String, String&gt;** | The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your DataLabelingJobs. Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with \&quot;aiplatform.googleapis.com/\&quot; and are immutable.
