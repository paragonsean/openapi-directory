Training pipeline will perform following transformation functions. * The text as is--no change to case, punctuation, spelling, tense, and so on. * Tokenize text to words. Convert each words to a dictionary lookup index and generate an embedding for each index. Combine the embedding of all elements into a single embedding using the mean. * Tokenization is based on unicode script boundaries. * Missing values get their own lookup index and resulting embedding. * Stop-words receive no special treatment and are not removed.
