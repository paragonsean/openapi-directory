## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**boundingBoxIou** | **Number** | Bounding box intersection-over-union precision. Measures how well the bounding boxes overlap between each other (e.g. complete overlap or just barely above iou_threshold). | [optional] 
**confidenceThreshold** | **Number** | The confidence threshold value used to compute the metrics. | [optional] 
**mismatchRate** | **Number** | Mismatch rate, which measures the tracking consistency, i.e. correctness of instance ID continuity. | [optional] 
**trackingPrecision** | **Number** | Tracking precision. | [optional] 
**trackingRecall** | **Number** | Tracking recall. | [optional]
