# **addCustomFieldSettingForProject**
> AddCustomFieldSettingForPortfolio200Response addCustomFieldSettingForProject(projectGid, addCustomFieldSettingForPortfolioRequest, optPretty)

Add a custom field to a project

Custom fields are associated with projects by way of custom field settings.  This method creates a setting for the project.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.auth.*;
import org.openapitools.client.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.ProjectsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://app.asana.com/api/1.0");
    
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: personalAccessToken
    HttpBearerAuth personalAccessToken = (HttpBearerAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("personalAccessToken");
    personalAccessToken.setBearerToken("BEARER TOKEN");

    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
    OAuth oauth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("oauth2");
    oauth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    ProjectsApi apiInstance = new ProjectsApi(defaultClient);
    String projectGid = "1331"; // String | Globally unique identifier for the project.
    AddCustomFieldSettingForPortfolioRequest addCustomFieldSettingForPortfolioRequest = new AddCustomFieldSettingForPortfolioRequest(); // AddCustomFieldSettingForPortfolioRequest | Information about the custom field setting.
    Boolean optPretty = true; // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
    try {
      AddCustomFieldSettingForPortfolio200Response result = apiInstance.addCustomFieldSettingForProject(projectGid, addCustomFieldSettingForPortfolioRequest, optPretty);
      System.out.println(result);

Add followers to a project

Adds the specified list of users as followers to the project. Followers are a subset of members who have opted in to receive \&quot;tasks added\&quot; notifications for a project. Therefore, if the users are not already members of the project, they will also become members as a result of this operation. Returns the updated project record.

Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
    try {
      CreateProject201Response result = apiInstance.addFollowersForProject(projectGid, addFollowersForProjectRequest, optPretty, optFields);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {

Returns the compact project records for all projects in the workspace.  If the workspace for your project is an organization, you must also supply a team to share the project with.  Returns the full record of the newly created project.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.auth.*;
import org.openapitools.client.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.ProjectsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://app.asana.com/api/1.0");
    
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: personalAccessToken
    HttpBearerAuth personalAccessToken = (HttpBearerAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("personalAccessToken");
    personalAccessToken.setBearerToken("BEARER TOKEN");

    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
    OAuth oauth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("oauth2");
    oauth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    ProjectsApi apiInstance = new ProjectsApi(defaultClient);
    String workspaceGid = "12345"; // String | Globally unique identifier for the workspace or organization.
    CreateProjectRequest createProjectRequest = new CreateProjectRequest(); // CreateProjectRequest | The new project to create.
    Boolean optPretty = true; // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
    List<String> optFields = Arrays.asList(); // List<String> | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
    try {
      CreateProject201Response result = apiInstance.createProjectForWorkspace(workspaceGid, createProjectRequest, optPretty, optFields);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **taskGid** | **String**| The task to operate on. | |
| **optPretty** | **Boolean**| Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. | [optional] |
| **optFields** | [**List&lt;String&gt;**](String.md)| Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options. | [optional] |
| **limit** | **Integer**| Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100. | [optional] |
| **offset** | **String**| Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. &#39;Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.&#39; | [optional] |
