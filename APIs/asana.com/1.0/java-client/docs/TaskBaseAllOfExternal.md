# TaskBaseAllOfExternal

*OAuth Required*. *Conditional*. This field is returned only if external values are set or included by using [Opt In] (/docs/input-output-options). The external field allows you to store app-specific metadata on tasks, including a gid that can be used to retrieve tasks and a data blob that can store app-specific character strings. Note that you will need to authenticate with Oauth to access or modify this data. Once an external gid is set, you can use the notation `external:custom_gid` to reference your object anywhere in the API where you may use the original object gid. See the page on Custom External Data for more details.
