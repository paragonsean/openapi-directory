# **addTaskForSection**
> DeleteAttachment200Response addTaskForSection(sectionGid, addTaskForSectionRequest, optPretty, optFields)

Add task to section

Add a task to a specific, existing section. This will remove the task from other sections of the project.  The task will be inserted at the top of a section unless an insert_before or insert_after parameter is declared.  This does not work for separators (tasks with the resource_subtype of section).

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.auth.*;
import org.openapitools.client.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.SectionsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://app.asana.com/api/1.0");
    
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: personalAccessToken
    HttpBearerAuth personalAccessToken = (HttpBearerAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("personalAccessToken");
    personalAccessToken.setBearerToken("BEARER TOKEN");

    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
    OAuth oauth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("oauth2");
    oauth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    SectionsApi apiInstance = new SectionsApi(defaultClient);
    String sectionGid = "321654"; // String | The globally unique identifier for the section.
    AddTaskForSectionRequest addTaskForSectionRequest = new AddTaskForSectionRequest(); // AddTaskForSectionRequest | The task and optionally the insert location.
    Boolean optPretty = true; // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
    List<String> optFields = Arrays.asList(); // List<String> | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
    try {
      DeleteAttachment200Response result = apiInstance.addTaskForSection(sectionGid, addTaskForSectionRequest, optPretty, optFields);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling SectionsApi#addTaskForSection");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();

# **updateSection**
> CreateSectionForProject201Response updateSection(sectionGid, createSectionForProjectRequest, optPretty, optFields)

Update a section

A specific, existing section can be updated by making a PUT request on the URL for that project. Only the fields provided in the &#x60;data&#x60; block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged. (note that at this time, the only field that can be updated is the &#x60;name&#x60; field.)  When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since you last retrieved the task.  Returns the complete updated section record.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.auth.*;
import org.openapitools.client.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.SectionsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://app.asana.com/api/1.0");
    
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: personalAccessToken
    HttpBearerAuth personalAccessToken = (HttpBearerAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("personalAccessToken");
    personalAccessToken.setBearerToken("BEARER TOKEN");

    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
    OAuth oauth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("oauth2");
    oauth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    SectionsApi apiInstance = new SectionsApi(defaultClient);
    String sectionGid = "321654"; // String | The globally unique identifier for the section.
    CreateSectionForProjectRequest createSectionForProjectRequest = new CreateSectionForProjectRequest(); // CreateSectionForProjectRequest | The section to create.
    Boolean optPretty = true; // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
    List<String> optFields = Arrays.asList(); // List<String> | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
    try {
      CreateSectionForProject201Response result = apiInstance.updateSection(sectionGid, createSectionForProjectRequest, optPretty, optFields);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling SectionsApi#updateSection");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
