# **addFollowers**
> CreateGoal201Response addFollowers(goalGid, addFollowersRequest, optPretty, optFields)

Add a collaborator to a goal

Adds followers to a goal. Returns the goal the followers were added to. Each goal can be associated with zero or more followers in the system. Requests to add/remove followers, if successful, will return the complete updated goal record, described above.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.auth.*;
import org.openapitools.client.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.GoalsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://app.asana.com/api/1.0");
    
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: personalAccessToken
    HttpBearerAuth personalAccessToken = (HttpBearerAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("personalAccessToken");
    personalAccessToken.setBearerToken("BEARER TOKEN");

    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
    OAuth oauth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("oauth2");
    oauth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    GoalsApi apiInstance = new GoalsApi(defaultClient);
    String goalGid = "12345"; // String | Globally unique identifier for the goal.
    AddFollowersRequest addFollowersRequest = new AddFollowersRequest(); // AddFollowersRequest | The followers to be added as collaborators
    Boolean optPretty = true; // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
    List<String> optFields = Arrays.asList(); // List<String> | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
    try {
      CreateGoal201Response result = apiInstance.addFollowers(goalGid, addFollowersRequest, optPretty, optFields);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
