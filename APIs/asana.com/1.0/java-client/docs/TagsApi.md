# **createTag**
> CreateTag201Response createTag(createTagRequest, optPretty, optFields)

Create a tag

Creates a new tag in a workspace or organization.  Every tag is required to be created in a specific workspace or organization, and this cannot be changed once set. Note that you can use the workspace parameter regardless of whether or not it is an organization.  Returns the full record of the newly created tag.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.auth.*;

    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: personalAccessToken
    HttpBearerAuth personalAccessToken = (HttpBearerAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("personalAccessToken");
    personalAccessToken.setBearerToken("BEARER TOKEN");

    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
    OAuth oauth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("oauth2");
    oauth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    TagsApi apiInstance = new TagsApi(defaultClient);
    CreateTagRequest createTagRequest = new CreateTagRequest(); // CreateTagRequest | The tag to create.
    Boolean optPretty = true; // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
    List<String> optFields = Arrays.asList(); // List<String> | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
    try {
      CreateTag201Response result = apiInstance.createTag(createTagRequest, optPretty, optFields);

<a id="getTagsForTask"></a>
# **getTagsForTask**
> GetTags200Response getTagsForTask(taskGid, optPretty, optFields, limit, offset)

Get a task&#39;s tags

Get a compact representation of all of the tags the task has.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.auth.*;
import org.openapitools.client.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.TagsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://app.asana.com/api/1.0");
    
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: personalAccessToken
    HttpBearerAuth personalAccessToken = (HttpBearerAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("personalAccessToken");
    personalAccessToken.setBearerToken("BEARER TOKEN");

    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
    OAuth oauth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("oauth2");
    oauth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    TagsApi apiInstance = new TagsApi(defaultClient);
    String taskGid = "321654"; // String | The task to operate on.
    Boolean optPretty = true; // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
    List<String> optFields = Arrays.asList(); // List<String> | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
    Integer limit = 50; // Integer | Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.
    String offset = "eyJ0eXAiOJiKV1iQLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9"; // String | Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. 'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'
    try {
      GetTags200Response result = apiInstance.getTagsForTask(taskGid, optPretty, optFields, limit, offset);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling TagsApi#getTagsForTask");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());

Update a tag

Updates the properties of a tag. Only the fields provided in the &#x60;data&#x60; block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.
