     * Establish a webhook
     * Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST request initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource.  Next, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake. When a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with an &#x60;X-Hook-Secret&#x60; header. The target must respond with a &#x60;200 OK&#x60; or &#x60;204 No Content&#x60; and a matching &#x60;X-Hook-Secret&#x60; header to confirm that this webhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing this secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures.  The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation handshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in response to your attempt to create it. This means you need to be able to receive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight (in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously).  Invalid hostnames like localhost will recieve a 403 Forbidden status code.  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; # Request curl -H \&quot;Authorization: Bearer &lt;personal_access_token&gt;\&quot; \\ -X POST https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/webhooks \\ -d \&quot;resource&#x3D;8675309\&quot; \\ -d \&quot;target&#x3D;https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654\&quot; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; # Handshake sent to https://example.com/ POST /receive-webhook/7654 X-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; # Handshake response sent by example.com HTTP/1.1 200 X-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; # Response HTTP/1.1 201 {   \&quot;data\&quot;: {     \&quot;gid\&quot;: \&quot;43214\&quot;,     \&quot;resource\&quot;: {       \&quot;gid\&quot;: \&quot;8675309\&quot;,       \&quot;name\&quot;: \&quot;Bugs\&quot;     },     \&quot;target\&quot;: \&quot;https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654\&quot;,     \&quot;active\&quot;: false,     \&quot;last_success_at\&quot;: null,     \&quot;last_failure_at\&quot;: null,     \&quot;last_failure_content\&quot;: null   } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

    /**
     * Update a webhook (asynchronously)
     * An existing webhook&#39;s filters can be updated by making a PUT request on the URL for that webhook. Note that the webhook&#39;s previous &#x60;filters&#x60; array will be completely overwritten by the &#x60;filters&#x60; sent in the PUT request.
     * @param webhookGid Globally unique identifier for the webhook. (required)
     * @param updateWebhookRequest The updated filters for the webhook. (required)
     * @param optPretty Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional)
     * @param optFields Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options. (optional)
     * @param _callback The callback to be executed when the API call finishes
     * @return The request call
     * @throws ApiException If fail to process the API call, e.g. serializing the request body object
     * @http.response.details
