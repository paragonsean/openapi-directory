## addCustomFieldSettingForProject

> AddCustomFieldSettingForPortfolio200Response addCustomFieldSettingForProject(projectGid, addCustomFieldSettingForPortfolioRequest, opts)

Add a custom field to a project

Custom fields are associated with projects by way of custom field settings.  This method creates a setting for the project.

### Example

```javascript
import Asana from 'asana';
let defaultClient = Asana.ApiClient.instance;
// Configure Bearer access token for authorization: personalAccessToken
let personalAccessToken = defaultClient.authentications['personalAccessToken'];
personalAccessToken.accessToken = "YOUR ACCESS TOKEN"
// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
let oauth2 = defaultClient.authentications['oauth2'];
oauth2.accessToken = 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN';

let apiInstance = new Asana.ProjectsApi();
let projectGid = "1331"; // String | Globally unique identifier for the project.
let addCustomFieldSettingForPortfolioRequest = new Asana.AddCustomFieldSettingForPortfolioRequest(); // AddCustomFieldSettingForPortfolioRequest | Information about the custom field setting.
let opts = {
  'optPretty': true // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
};
apiInstance.addCustomFieldSettingForProject(projectGid, addCustomFieldSettingForPortfolioRequest, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {

## addFollowersForProject

> CreateProject201Response addFollowersForProject(projectGid, addFollowersForProjectRequest, opts)

Add followers to a project

Adds the specified list of users as followers to the project. Followers are a subset of members who have opted in to receive \&quot;tasks added\&quot; notifications for a project. Therefore, if the users are not already members of the project, they will also become members as a result of this operation. Returns the updated project record.

## updateProject

> CreateProject201Response updateProject(projectGid, createProjectRequest, opts)

Update a project

A specific, existing project can be updated by making a PUT request on the URL for that project. Only the fields provided in the &#x60;data&#x60; block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

personalAccessToken.accessToken = "YOUR ACCESS TOKEN"
// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
let oauth2 = defaultClient.authentications['oauth2'];
oauth2.accessToken = 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN';

let apiInstance = new Asana.ProjectsApi();
let projectGid = "1331"; // String | Globally unique identifier for the project.
let createProjectRequest = new Asana.CreateProjectRequest(); // CreateProjectRequest | The updated fields for the project.
