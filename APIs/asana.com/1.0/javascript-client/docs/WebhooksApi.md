## createWebhook

> CreateWebhook201Response createWebhook(createWebhookRequest, opts)

Establish a webhook

Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST request initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource.  Next, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake. When a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with an &#x60;X-Hook-Secret&#x60; header. The target must respond with a &#x60;200 OK&#x60; or &#x60;204 No Content&#x60; and a matching &#x60;X-Hook-Secret&#x60; header to confirm that this webhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing this secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures.  The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation handshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in response to your attempt to create it. This means you need to be able to receive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight (in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously).  Invalid hostnames like localhost will recieve a 403 Forbidden status code.  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; # Request curl -H \&quot;Authorization: Bearer &lt;personal_access_token&gt;\&quot; \\ -X POST https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/webhooks \\ -d \&quot;resource&#x3D;8675309\&quot; \\ -d \&quot;target&#x3D;https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654\&quot; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; # Handshake sent to https://example.com/ POST /receive-webhook/7654 X-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; # Handshake response sent by example.com HTTP/1.1 200 X-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; # Response HTTP/1.1 201 {   \&quot;data\&quot;: {     \&quot;gid\&quot;: \&quot;43214\&quot;,     \&quot;resource\&quot;: {       \&quot;gid\&quot;: \&quot;8675309\&quot;,       \&quot;name\&quot;: \&quot;Bugs\&quot;     },     \&quot;target\&quot;: \&quot;https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654\&quot;,     \&quot;active\&quot;: false,     \&quot;last_success_at\&quot;: null,     \&quot;last_failure_at\&quot;: null,     \&quot;last_failure_content\&quot;: null   } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### Example

```javascript
import Asana from 'asana';
let defaultClient = Asana.ApiClient.instance;
// Configure Bearer access token for authorization: personalAccessToken
let personalAccessToken = defaultClient.authentications['personalAccessToken'];
personalAccessToken.accessToken = "YOUR ACCESS TOKEN"
// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
let oauth2 = defaultClient.authentications['oauth2'];
oauth2.accessToken = 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN';

let apiInstance = new Asana.WebhooksApi();
let createWebhookRequest = new Asana.CreateWebhookRequest(); // CreateWebhookRequest | The webhook workspace and target.
let opts = {
  'optPretty': true, // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
  'optFields': ["null"] // [String] | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
};
apiInstance.createWebhook(createWebhookRequest, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
});
