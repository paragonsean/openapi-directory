personalAccessToken.accessToken = "YOUR ACCESS TOKEN"
// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
let oauth2 = defaultClient.authentications['oauth2'];

let apiInstance = new Asana.ProjectTemplatesApi();
let projectTemplateGid = "1331"; // String | Globally unique identifier for the project template.
let opts = {
  'optPretty': true, // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
  'optFields': ["null"] // [String] | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently.

## instantiateProject

> GetJob200Response instantiateProject(projectTemplateGid, opts)

Instantiate a project from a project template

Creates and returns a job that will asynchronously handle the project instantiation.  To form this request, it is recommended to first make a request to [get a project template](/docs/get-a-project-template). Then, from the response, copy the &#x60;gid&#x60; from the object in the &#x60;requested_dates&#x60; array. This &#x60;gid&#x60; should be used in &#x60;requested_dates&#x60; to instantiate a project.  _Note: The body of this request will differ if your workspace is an organization. To determine if your workspace is an organization, use the [is_organization](/docs/workspace) parameter._

### Example

import Asana from 'asana';
let defaultClient = Asana.ApiClient.instance;
// Configure Bearer access token for authorization: personalAccessToken
let personalAccessToken = defaultClient.authentications['personalAccessToken'];
