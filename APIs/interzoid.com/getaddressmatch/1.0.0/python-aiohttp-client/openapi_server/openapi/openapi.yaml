  description: "This API provides a similarity key used to match with other similar\
    \ street address data, including for purposes of deduplication, fuzzy matching,\
    \ or merging of datasets. A much higher match rate will be achieved by matching\
    \ on the algorithmically generated similarity key rather than the data itself."
