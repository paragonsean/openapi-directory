/**
 * OpenFEC
 * This application programming interface (API) allows you to explore the way candidates and committees fund their campaigns.    The Federal Election Commission (FEC) API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text and field-specific searches on FEC data. [Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly.    There are a lot of data, and a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check out contributor information in the `/schedule_a/` endpoints.    <b class=\"body\" id=\"getting_started_head\">Getting started with the openFEC API</b><br>    If you would like to use the FEC's API programmatically, you can sign up for your own API key using our form. Alternatively, you can still try out our API without an API key by using the web interface and using DEMO_KEY. Note that when you use the openFEC API you are subject to the [Terms of Service](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/TERMS-OF-SERVICE.md) and [Acceptable Use policy](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/ACCEPTABLE-USE-POLICY.md).    Signing up for an API key will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get a key for 7,200 calls an hour (120 calls per minute) to <a href=\"mailto:APIinfo@fec.gov\">APIinfo@fec.gov</a>. You can also ask questions and discuss the data in a community led [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data).    The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data.    A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations. [Learn more here](https://www.fec.gov/updates/sale-or-use-contributor-information/).

     *  Each report represents the summary information from Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P. These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee. Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings.  By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to retrieve only reports that have been amended, use `is_amended=true`.  Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements, look at the summary and detailed summary pages of Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.  DISCLAIMER: The field labels contained within this resource are subject to change.  We are attempting to succinctly label these fields while conveying clear meaning to ensure accessibility for all users.

     *  Each report represents the summary information from Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P. These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee. Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings.  By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to retrieve only reports that have been amended, use `is_amended=true`.  Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements, look at the summary and detailed summary pages of Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.
