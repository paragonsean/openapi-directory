     Each report represents the summary information from Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P. These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee. Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements are especially helpful for understanding a committee&#39;s financial dealings.  By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict to only the final versions of each report, use &#x60;is_amended&#x3D;false&#x60;; to retrieve only reports that have been amended, use &#x60;is_amended&#x3D;true&#x60;.
