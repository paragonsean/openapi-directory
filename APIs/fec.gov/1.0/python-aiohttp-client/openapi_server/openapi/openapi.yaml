  description: "This application programming interface (API) allows you to explore\
    \ the way candidates and committees fund their campaigns. \n\n The Federal Election\
    \ Commission (FEC) API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text and field-specific\
    \ searches on FEC data. [Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data)\
    \ are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms\
    \ by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly. \n\n There are a lot of data,\
    \ and a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and\
    \ committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details\
    \ with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check\
    \ out contributor information in the `/schedule_a/` endpoints. \n\n <b class=\"\
    body\" id=\"getting_started_head\">Getting started with the openFEC API</b><br>\
    \ \n\n If you would like to use the FEC's API programmatically, you can sign up\
    \ for your own API key using our form. Alternatively, you can still try out our\
    \ API without an API key by using the web interface and using DEMO_KEY. Note that\
    \ when you use the openFEC API you are subject to the [Terms of Service](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/TERMS-OF-SERVICE.md)\
    \ and [Acceptable Use policy](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/ACCEPTABLE-USE-POLICY.md).\
    \ \n\n Signing up for an API key will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an\
    \ hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions,\
    \ comments or a request to get a key for 7,200 calls an hour (120 calls per minute)\
    \ to <a href=\"mailto:APIinfo@fec.gov\">APIinfo@fec.gov</a>. You can also ask\
    \ questions and discuss the data in a community led [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data).\
    \ \n\n The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/).\
    \ This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data. \n\n A few restrictions\
    \ limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor lists\
    \ for commercial purposes or to solicit donations. [Learn more here](https://www.fec.gov/updates/sale-or-use-contributor-information/).\

        Returns CSV or ICS for downloading directly into calendar applications like Google, Outlook or other applications.

        Combines the election and reporting dates with Commission meetings, conferences, outreach, Advisory Opinions, rules, litigation dates and other
        events into one calendar.

        State filtering now applies to elections, reports and reporting periods.

        Presidential pre-primary report due dates are not shown on even years.
        Filers generally opt to file monthly rather than submit over 50 pre-primary election
        reports. All reporting deadlines are available at /reporting-dates/ for reference.

        This is [the sql function](https://github.com/fecgov/openFEC/blob/develop/data/migrations/V40__omnibus_dates.sql)
        that creates the calendar.

          the entire four years of a presidential term or six years of a senatorial term,
          you will need the `election_full` flag.

        This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports,
        which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.

        The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To obtain
        totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle
        is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.

        For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.

        Each report represents the summary information from Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P.
        These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee.
        Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements
        are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings.

        By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict
        to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to retrieve only reports that
        have been amended, use `is_amended=true`.

        Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that
        submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements,
        look at the summary and detailed summary pages of Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.

        This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports,
        which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.

        The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To obtain
        totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle
        is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.

        For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.

        Key financial data reported periodically by committees as they are reported. This feed includes summary
        information from the the House F3 reports, the presidential F3p reports and the PAC and party
        F3x reports.

        Generally, committees file reports on a quarterly or monthly basis, but
        some must also submit a report 12 days before primary elections. Therefore, during the primary
        season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals
        also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended.

        DISCLAIMER: The field labels contained within this resource are subject to change.  We are attempting to succinctly
        label these fields while conveying clear meaning to ensure accessibility for all users.

        If you are looking for a Senate seat, you will need to select the state using a two-letter

        House races require state and a two-digit district number.

        Each report represents the summary information from Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P.
        These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee.
        Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements
        are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings.

        By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict
        to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to retrieve only reports that
        have been amended, use `is_amended=true`.

        Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that
        submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements,
        look at the summary and detailed summary pages of Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.

      description: "\nThis description is for both ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` and\
        \ ​ `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/`.\n\nThis endpoint provides itemized\
        \ receipts. Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions\
        \ from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from an individual,\
        \ use the `/schedules/schedule_a/` endpoint. For a more complete description\
        \ of all Schedule A records visit [About receipts data](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/about-receipts-data/).\
        \ If you are interested in our \"is_individual\" methodology visit our [methodology\
        \ page](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/methodology/).\
        \ \n​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/` endpoint is not paginated by page number.\
        \ This endpoint uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these\
        \ indices are required to properly page through this large dataset. To request\
        \ the next page, you should append the values found in the `last_indexes`\
        \ object from pagination to the URL of your last request as additional parameters.\
        \ \nFor example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive\
        \ a page of results with the two scenarios of following pagination information:\n\
        \ncase #1:\n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 2152643,\n    per_page: 20,\n \
        \   count: 43052850,\n    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230880619\"\
        ,\n        last_contribution_receipt_date: \"2014-01-01\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\
        <br/>\ncase #2 (results which include contribution_receipt_date = NULL):\n\
        \n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 2152644,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 43052850,\n\
        \    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230880639\",\n        sort_null_only:\
        \ True\n    }\n}\n```\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619`\
        \ and `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL and when reaching\
        \ `contribution_receipt_date=NULL`, append `last_index=230880639` and `sort_null_only=True`.\
        \ We strongly advise paging through these results using sort indices. The\
        \ default sort is acending by `contribution_receipt_date` (`deprecated`, will\
        \ be descending). If you do not page using sort indices, some transactions\
        \ may be unintentionally filtered out.\n\nCalls to ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​\
        /` may return many records. For large result sets, the record counts found\
        \ in the pagination object are approximate; you will need to page through\
        \ the records until no records are returned.\n\nTo avoid throwing the \"out\
        \ of range\" exception on the last page, one recommandation is to use total\
        \ count and `per_page` to control the traverse loop of results.\n\n​The `/schedules​\
        /schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/` endpoint returns a single transaction, but it does\
        \ include a pagination object class. Please ignore the information in that\
        \ object class.\n\n"

      description: "\nThis description is for both ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` and\
        \ ​ `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/`.\n\nThis endpoint provides itemized\
        \ receipts. Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions\
        \ from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from an individual,\
        \ use the `/schedules/schedule_a/` endpoint. For a more complete description\
        \ of all Schedule A records visit [About receipts data](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/about-receipts-data/).\
        \ If you are interested in our \"is_individual\" methodology visit our [methodology\
        \ page](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/methodology/).\
        \ \n​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/` endpoint is not paginated by page number.\
        \ This endpoint uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these\
        \ indices are required to properly page through this large dataset. To request\
        \ the next page, you should append the values found in the `last_indexes`\
        \ object from pagination to the URL of your last request as additional parameters.\
        \ \nFor example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive\
        \ a page of results with the two scenarios of following pagination information:\n\
        \ncase #1:\n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 2152643,\n    per_page: 20,\n \
        \   count: 43052850,\n    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230880619\"\
        ,\n        last_contribution_receipt_date: \"2014-01-01\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\
        <br/>\ncase #2 (results which include contribution_receipt_date = NULL):\n\
        \n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 2152644,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 43052850,\n\
        \    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230880639\",\n        sort_null_only:\
        \ True\n    }\n}\n```\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619`\
        \ and `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL and when reaching\
        \ `contribution_receipt_date=NULL`, append `last_index=230880639` and `sort_null_only=True`.\
        \ We strongly advise paging through these results using sort indices. The\
        \ default sort is acending by `contribution_receipt_date` (`deprecated`, will\
        \ be descending). If you do not page using sort indices, some transactions\
        \ may be unintentionally filtered out.\n\nCalls to ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​\
        /` may return many records. For large result sets, the record counts found\
        \ in the pagination object are approximate; you will need to page through\
        \ the records until no records are returned.\n\nTo avoid throwing the \"out\
        \ of range\" exception on the last page, one recommandation is to use total\
        \ count and `per_page` to control the traverse loop of results.\n\n​The `/schedules​\
        /schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/` endpoint returns a single transaction, but it does\
        \ include a pagination object class. Please ignore the information in that\
        \ object class.\n\n"

          specified, the results default to the most current cycle.

        Schedule B filings describe itemized disbursements. This data
        explains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are
        reported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.

        The data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which
        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will
        default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,
        even-numbered year.

        Due to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by
        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in
        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For
        example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of
        results with the following pagination information:

        ```
        pagination: {
            pages: 965191,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 19303814,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230906248",
                last_disbursement_date: "2014-07-04"
            }
        }
        ```

        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and
        `last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through
        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g.
        `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.
        This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance
        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.

        Note: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for
        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

        Schedule B filings describe itemized disbursements. This data
        explains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are
        reported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.

        The data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which
        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will
        default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,
        even-numbered year.

        Due to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by
        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in
        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For
        example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of
        results with the following pagination information:

        ```
        pagination: {
            pages: 965191,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 19303814,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230906248",
                last_disbursement_date: "2014-07-04"
            }
        }
        ```

        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and
        `last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through
        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g.
        `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.
        This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance
        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.

        Note: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for
        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

    get:

        Schedule E covers the line item expenditures for independent expenditures. For example, if a super PAC
        bought ads on TV to oppose a federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with
        the expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate.

        An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication "expressly advocating the election or
        defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,
        or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or
        a political party or its agents."

        Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures
        and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in
        `/schedule/schedule_e/`.

        Due to the large quantity of Schedule E filings, this endpoint is not paginated by
        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in
        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For
        example, when sorting by `expenditure_amount`, you might receive a page of
        results with the following pagination information:

        ```
         "pagination": {
            "count": 152623,
            "last_indexes": {
              "last_index": "3023037",
              "last_expenditure_amount": -17348.5
            },
            "per_page": 20,
            "pages": 7632
          }
        }
        ```

        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=3023037` and
        `last_expenditure_amount=` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through
        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date,
        e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally
        filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance
        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.

        Note: because the Schedule E data includes many records, counts for
        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

        This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports,
        which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.

        The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To obtain
        totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle
        is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.

        For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.

            an odd year and is named for its ending, even year. This cycle follows
            the traditional house election cycle and subdivides the presidential
            and Senate elections into comparable two-year blocks. To retrieve data for
            the entire four years of a presidential term or six years of a senatorial term,
            you will need the `election_full` flag.

            Two-year election cycle in which a candidate runs for office.
            Calculated from Form 2. The cycle begins with
            an odd year and is named for its ending, even year. This cycle follows
            the traditional house election cycle and subdivides the presidential
            and Senate elections into comparable two-year blocks. To retrieve data for
            the entire four years of a presidential term or six years of a senatorial term,
            you will need the `election_full` flag.

            If a person runs for several offices, that person will have separate candidate IDs for each office.
            First character indicates office - [P]residential, [H]ouse, [S]enate].
            Second character is the last digit of the two-year period the ID was created.
            Third and fourth is the candidate state. Presidential IDs don't have state.
            Fifth and sixth is the district when the candidate first ran. This does not change if the
            candidate/member's district changes during re-districting. Presidential IDs don't have districts.
            The rest is sequence.

            First character indicates office - [P]residential, [H]ouse, [S]enate].
            Second character is the last digit of the two-year period the ID was created.
            Third and fourth is the candidate state. Presidential IDs don't have state.
            Fifth and sixth is the district when the candidate first ran. This does not change if the
            candidate/member's district changes during re-districting. Presidential IDs don't have districts.

            This is a two-year period that is derived from the year a transaction took place in the
            Itemized Schedule A and Schedule B tables. In cases where we have the date of the transaction
            (contribution_receipt_date in schedules/schedule_a, disbursement_date in schedules/schedule_b)
            the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not
            have the date  of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both
            tables) instead,  making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is
            specified, the results default to the most current cycle.

            A unique identifier assigned to each candidate registered with the FEC.
            If a person runs for several offices, that person will have separate candidate IDs for each office.
            First character indicates office - [P]residential, [H]ouse, [S]enate].
            Second character is the last digit of the two-year period the ID was created.
            Third and fourth is the candidate state. Presidential IDs don't have state.
            Fifth and sixth is the district when the candidate first ran. This does not change if the
            candidate/member's district changes during re-districting. Presidential IDs don't have districts.
            The rest is sequence.

            First character indicates office - [P]residential, [H]ouse, [S]enate].
            Second character is the last digit of the two-year period the ID was created.
            Third and fourth is the candidate state. Presidential IDs don't have state.
            Fifth and sixth is the district when the candidate first ran. This does not change if the
            candidate/member's district changes during re-districting. Presidential IDs don't have districts.

            If a person runs for several offices, that person will have separate candidate IDs for each office.
            First character indicates office - [P]residential, [H]ouse, [S]enate].
            Second character is the last digit of the two-year period the ID was created.
            Third and fourth is the candidate state. Presidential IDs don't have state.
            Fifth and sixth is the district when the candidate first ran. This does not change if the
            candidate/member's district changes during re-districting. Presidential IDs don't have districts.
            The rest is sequence.
