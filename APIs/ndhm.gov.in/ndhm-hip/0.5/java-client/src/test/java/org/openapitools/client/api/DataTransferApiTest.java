 * Health Repository Provider Specifications for HIP
 * The following are the specifications for the APIs to be implemented at the Health Repository end if an entity is only serving the role of a HIP. The specs are essentially duplicates from the Gateway and Health Repository, but put together so as to make it clear to *HIPs* which set of APIs they should implement to participate in the network.

     * health information transfer API

     * **NOTE**: This API is actually the callback URL that is passed as **dataPushUrl** in the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request. This API is directly called by HIP Data Bridge and is not mediated via CM, and hence not routed through the Gateway.    1. This API should be implemented at HIU side. It maybe implemented by the Data Bridge representing the HIU.    2. Entry elements maybe ***content*** or ***link***, although for version 1, entry ***content*** is preferred.    3. Entry ***content*** (or even link reference content) must be encrypted by means of Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman Key Exchange, utilizing the HIU keymaterials that are passed through the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request.    4. Media contains the mimetype of content, and for v1, it is \&quot;application/fhir+json\&quot;   5. checksum is Md5 checksum of the data conent, before encryption   6. Please refer to the NDHM Sandbox Documentation for the format of FHIR bundle that is passed through content
