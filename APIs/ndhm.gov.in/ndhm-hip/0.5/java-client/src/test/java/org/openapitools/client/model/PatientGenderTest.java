 * The following are the specifications for the APIs to be implemented at the Health Repository end if an entity is only serving the role of a HIP. The specs are essentially duplicates from the Gateway and Health Repository, but put together so as to make it clear to *HIPs* which set of APIs they should implement to participate in the network.
