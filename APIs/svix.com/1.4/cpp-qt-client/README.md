# Introduction

This is the reference documentation and schemas for the [Svix webhook service](https://www.svix.com) API. For tutorials and other documentation please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.svix.com).

## Main concepts

In Svix you have four important entities you will be interacting with:

- `messages`: these are the webhooks being sent. They can have contents and a few other properties.
- `application`: this is where `messages` are sent to. Usually you want to create one application for each user on your platform.
- `endpoint`: endpoints are the URLs messages will be sent to. Each application can have multiple `endpoints` and each message sent to that application will be sent to all of them (unless they are not subscribed to the sent event type).
- `event-type`: event types are identifiers denoting the type of the message being sent. Event types are primarily used to decide which events are sent to which endpoint.


## Authentication

Get your authentication token (`AUTH_TOKEN`) from the [Svix dashboard](https://dashboard.svix.com) and use it as part of the `Authorization` header as such: `Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}`.

<SecurityDefinitions />


## Code samples

The code samples assume you already have the respective libraries installed and you know how to use them. For the latest information on how to do that, please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.svix.com/).


## Idempotency

Svix supports [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. This is useful when an API call is disrupted in transit and you do not receive a response.

To perform an idempotent request, pass the idempotency key in the `Idempotency-Key` header to the request. The idempotency key should be a unique value generated by the client. You can create the key in however way you like, though we suggest using UUID v4, or any other string with enough entropy to avoid collisions.

Svix's idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key for any successful request. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result.

Please note that idempotency is only supported for `POST` requests.


## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser. All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:

1. CMake 3.2+
2. Qt
3. C++ Compiler

## Getting Started

example.h:
```c++

#include <iostream>
#include "../client/OAIApplicationApi.h"

using namespace test_namespace;

class Example : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT
    OAIApplicationIn create();
    bool create();
    QString create();
public Q_SLOTS:
   void exampleFunction1();
};

```

example.cpp:
```c++

#include "../client/OAIApplicationApi.h"
#include "example.h"
#include <QTimer>
#include <QEventLoop>

OAIApplicationIn Example::create(){
    OAIApplicationIn obj;
bool Example::create(){
    bool obj;
QString Example::create(){
    QString obj;
 return obj;
}

void Example::exampleFunction1(){
     OAIApplicationApi apiInstance;
     
      // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: HTTPBearer
      apiInstance.setBearerToken("BEARER TOKEN");

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIApplicationApi::createApplicationApiV1AppPostSignal, [&]() {
          loop.quit();
      });
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIApplicationApi::createApplicationApiV1AppPostSignalE, [&](QNetworkReply::NetworkError, QString error_str) {
          qDebug() << "Error happened while issuing request : " << error_str;
          loop.quit();
      });

      OAIApplicationIn oai_application_in = create(); // OAIApplicationIn | 

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIApplicationApi::createApplicationApiV1AppPostSignal, [&]() {
          loop.quit();
      });
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIApplicationApi::createApplicationApiV1AppPostSignalE, [&](QNetworkReply::NetworkError, QString error_str) {
          qDebug() << "Error happened while issuing request : " << error_str;
          loop.quit();
      });

      bool get_if_exists = create(); // bool | Get an existing application, or create a new one if doesn't exist. It's two separate functions in the libs.

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIApplicationApi::createApplicationApiV1AppPostSignal, [&]() {
          loop.quit();
      });
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIApplicationApi::createApplicationApiV1AppPostSignalE, [&](QNetworkReply::NetworkError, QString error_str) {
          qDebug() << "Error happened while issuing request : " << error_str;
          loop.quit();
      });

      QString idempotency_key = create(); // QString | The request's idempotency key
      apiInstance.createApplicationApiV1AppPost(oai_application_inget_if_existsidempotency_key);
      QTimer::singleShot(5000, &loop, &QEventLoop::quit);
      loop.exec();
  }

```

## Documentation for Servers

Parameterized Servers are supported. Define a server in the API for each endpoint with arbitrary numbers of variables:

```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:{port}/{basePath}
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
    port:
      enum:
        - '3000'
        - '1000'
      default: '3000'
    basePath:
      default: v1
```
To change the default variable, use this function in each Api:
```c++
int setDefaultServerValue(int serverIndex,const QString &operation, const QString &variable,const QString &val);
```
The parameter "serverIndex" will choose a server from the server list for each endpoint. There is always at least one server with index 0. The Parameter "operation" should be the desired endpoint operationid.
Variable is the name of the variable you wish to change and the value is the new default Value.
The function will return -1 when the variable does not exists, -2 if value is not defined in the variable enum and -3 if the operation is not found.

If your endpoint has multiple server objects in the servers array, you can set the server that will be used with this function:
```c++
void setServerIndex(const QString &operation, int serverIndex);
```
Parameter "operation" should be your operationid. "serverIndex" is the index you want to set as your default server. The function will check if there is a server with your index.
Here is an example of multiple servers in the servers array. The first server will have index 0 and the second will have index 1.
```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:8080/
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
- url: https://localhost:8080/v1
```
