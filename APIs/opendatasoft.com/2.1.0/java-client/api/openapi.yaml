          A select expression can be used to add, remove or change fields to return.
          An expression can be:
            - a wildcard ('*'): return all fields
            - a field name: return only this field
            - an include/exclude function. Include (resp exclude) all field matching include/exclude expression. This expression can contain wildcard. For example: include(spa*) will return all fields begining with 'spa'
            - a complex expression: return the result of this expression. A label can be set for this expression, in that case, field will be named with this label. For instance: 'size * 2 as bigger_size' will return a new field named bigger_size and containing the double of size field value.

          A select expression can be used to add, remove or change fields to return.
          An expression can be:
            - a wildcard ('*'): return all fields
            - a field name: return only this field
            - an include/exclude function. Include (resp exclude) all field matching include/exclude expression. This expression can contain wildcard. For example: include(spa*) will return all fields begining with 'spa'
            - a complex expression: return the result of this expression. A label can be set for this expression, in that case, field will be named with this label. For instance: 'size * 2 as bigger_size' will return a new field named bigger_size and containing the double of size field value.

        An array of filters.

        A filter is a text expression performing a simple full-text search that can also include logical operations
        (NOT, AND, OR...) as well as lots of other functions, thus performing more complex and more precise searches.

        Read [the query language reference](https://docs.opendatasoft.com/api/explore/v2.html#where-clause) for more details.

        Supports geo queries with the following functions:
        * distance(myfield, center, radius): restrict entries to those where {myfield} is less than {radius} from {center} (center being defined 'lat,lon')
        * bbox(myfield, topleft, bottomright): restrict entries to those where {myfield} is within the bounds defined by the two sets of coordinates {topleft} and {bottomright}
        * polygon(myfield, mypolygon): restrict entries to those where {myfield} is within the bounds of {mypolygon}; {mypolygon} being a list of 'lat,lon' vertices
        * wkt(myfield, mywkt): restrict entries to those where {myfield} is within the body of {mywkt}; {mywkt} being a Well Known Text (see 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text' for reference)
