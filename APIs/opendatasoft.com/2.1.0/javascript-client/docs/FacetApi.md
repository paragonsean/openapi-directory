## getDatasetsFacets_0

> GetRecordsFacets200Response getDatasetsFacets_0(source, opts)



Enumerate facets values for datasets and return a list of values for each facet. Can be used to implement guided navigation in large result sets.  Read [the facets documentation](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-search-v2/#enumerating-facets-values) for more details. 

### Example

```javascript
import Opendatasoft from 'opendatasoft';
let defaultClient = Opendatasoft.ApiClient.instance;
// Configure API key authorization: api_key
let api_key = defaultClient.authentications['api_key'];
api_key.apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
// Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
//api_key.apiKeyPrefix = 'Token';
// Configure HTTP basic authorization: basic
let basic = defaultClient.authentications['basic'];
basic.username = 'YOUR USERNAME';
basic.password = 'YOUR PASSWORD';

let apiInstance = new Opendatasoft.FacetApi();
let source = "'catalog'"; // String | Each source represents a different catalog of datasets you'll be able to query.  There are 2 sources available:  * catalog: the catalog of datasets on your portal * opendatasoft: Opendatasoft's repository of public datasets, also available at   [data.opendatasoft.com](https://data.opendatasoft.com/page/home/) 
let opts = {
  'facet': ["null"], // [String] | A facet is a field used for simple filtering (through the parameters refine and exclude) or exploration (with the endpoint `/facets`).  Facets can be configured in the back-office or with this parameter.  Read [the facets documentation](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-search-v2/#facets) for more details. 
  'refine': ["null"], // [String] | An array of facet filters. For example **city:Paris** or **modified:2019/12**. The request will only include the selected facet value.  Read [filtering with facets value](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-search-v2/#filtering-with-facets-values) for more details.  *Not to be confused with a where filter. Refining with a facet is equivalent to selecting an entry in the left navigation panel.*  *refine is not available for monitoring sources* 
  'exclude': ["null"], // [String] | An array of facet filters. For example **city:Paris** or **modified:2019/12**. The request will exclude the defined facet value.  Read [filtering with facets value](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-search-v2/#filtering-with-facets-values) for more details.  *Not to be confused with a where filter. Excluding a facet value is equivalent to removing an entry in the left navigation panel.*  *exclude is not available for monitoring sources* 
  'where': ["null"], // [String] | An array of filters.  A filter is a text expression performing a simple full-text search that can also include logical operations (NOT, AND, OR...) as well as lots of other functions, thus performing more complex and more precise searches.  Read [the query language reference](https://docs.opendatasoft.com/api/explore/v2.html#where-clause) for more details. 
  'search': ["null"], // [String] | An array of full text search.  A full text search performs a prefixed text search for each provided terms in all visible fields of a catalog/dataset. 
  'timezone': "'UTC'" // String | Set timezone for datetime fields
};
apiInstance.getDatasetsFacets_0(source, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
