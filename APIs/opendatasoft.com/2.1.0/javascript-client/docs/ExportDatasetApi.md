### Example

```javascript
import Opendatasoft from 'opendatasoft';
let defaultClient = Opendatasoft.ApiClient.instance;
// Configure API key authorization: api_key
let api_key = defaultClient.authentications['api_key'];
api_key.apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
// Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
//api_key.apiKeyPrefix = 'Token';
// Configure HTTP basic authorization: basic
let basic = defaultClient.authentications['basic'];
basic.username = 'YOUR USERNAME';

let apiInstance = new Opendatasoft.ExportDatasetApi();
let source = "'catalog'"; // String | Each source represents a different catalog of datasets you'll be able to query.  There are 2 sources available:  * catalog: the catalog of datasets on your portal * opendatasoft: Opendatasoft's repository of public datasets, also available at   [data.opendatasoft.com](https://data.opendatasoft.com/page/home/) 
let datasetId = "datasetId_example"; // String | Dataset identifier.  Can be found in the \"information\" tab of the dataset page. 
let opts = {
  'select': "select_example", // String | A select expression can be used to add, remove or change fields to return. An expression can be:   - a wildcard ('*'): return all fields   - a field name: return only this field   - an include/exclude function. Include (resp exclude) all field matching include/exclude expression. This expression can contain wildcard. For example: include(spa*) will return all fields begining with 'spa'   - a complex expression: return the result of this expression. A label can be set for this expression, in that case, field will be named with this label. For instance: 'size * 2 as bigger_size' will return a new field named bigger_size and containing the double of size field value. 
  'where': ["null"], // [String] | An array of filters.  A filter is a text expression performing a simple full-text search that can also include logical operations (NOT, AND, OR...) as well as lots of other functions, thus performing more complex and more precise searches.

By default, the sort is ascending (from the smallest value to the biggest value). A minus sign (‘-‘) may be used to perform a descending sort. Sorting is only available on numeric fields (int, double, date and datetime) and on text fields which have the sortable annotation. 
  'orderBy': ["null"], // [String] | A comma-separated list of field names or aggregations to sort on, followed by an order (`asc` or `desc`).  Sorts results according to the specified fields' values in ascending order by default. To sort results in descending order, use the `desc` keyword.  Example: `sum(age) desc, name asc` 
  'limit': -1, // Number | Number of items to return in export.  Use -1 (default) to retrieve all records 
  'offset': 0, // Number | Index of the first item to return (starting at 0).  To use in conjonction with limit to implement pagination. 
  'facet': ["null"], // [String] | A facet is a field used for simple filtering (through the parameters refine and exclude) or exploration (with the endpoint `/facets`).  Facets can be configured in the back-office or with this parameter.  Read [the facets documentation](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-search-v2/#facets) for more details. 
  'refine': ["null"], // [String] | An array of facet filters. For example **city:Paris** or **modified:2019/12**. The request will only include the selected facet value.

Sorting is only available on numeric fields (int, double, date and datetime) and on text fields which have the sortable annotation.  | [optional] 
 **orderBy** | [**[String]**](String.md)| A comma-separated list of field names or aggregations to sort on, followed by an order (&#x60;asc&#x60; or &#x60;desc&#x60;).  Sorts results according to the specified fields&#39; values in ascending order by default. To sort results in descending order, use the &#x60;desc&#x60; keyword.  Example: &#x60;sum(age) desc, name asc&#x60;  | [optional] 
 **limit** | **Number**| Number of items to return in export.  Use -1 (default) to retrieve all records  | [optional] [default to -1]

 **search** | [**[String]**](String.md)| An array of full text search.  A full text search performs a prefixed text search for each provided terms in all visible fields of a catalog/dataset.  | [optional] 
 **facet** | [**[String]**](String.md)| A facet is a field used for simple filtering (through the parameters refine and exclude) or exploration (with the endpoint &#x60;/facets&#x60;).  Facets can be configured in the back-office or with this parameter.  Read [the facets documentation](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-search-v2/#facets) for more details.  | [optional] 
 **refine** | [**[String]**](String.md)| An array of facet filters. For example **city:Paris** or **modified:2019/12**. The request will only include the selected facet value.  Read [filtering with facets value](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-search-v2/#filtering-with-facets-values) for more details.  *Not to be confused with a where filter. Refining with a facet is equivalent to selecting an entry in the left navigation panel.*  *refine is not available for monitoring sources*  | [optional] 
 **exclude** | [**[String]**](String.md)| An array of facet filters. For example **city:Paris** or **modified:2019/12**. The request will exclude the defined facet value.  Read [filtering with facets value](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-search-v2/#filtering-with-facets-values) for more details.  *Not to be confused with a where filter.

api_key.apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
// Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
//api_key.apiKeyPrefix = 'Token';
