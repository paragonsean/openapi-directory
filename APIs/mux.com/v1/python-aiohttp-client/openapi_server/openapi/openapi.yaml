    Mux Real-Time Video has been sunset and is unavailiable for new usage.
    Existing access will end on December 31, 2023.
    We [recommend migrating your application to our partner, LiveKit](https://livekit.io/mux-livekit).
    Please reach out to [real-time-video@mux.com](mailto:real-time-video@mux.com) if you need more help or details.


    Spaces allow developers to build real-time video and audio experiences
    into their applications via the
    [Real-Time Video product.](https://mux.com/real-time-video)


    Composited video of space sessions can be sent to live streams using broadcasts.


    To add real-time video to an application, you'll also need to integrate one of our
    [Real-Time Video SDKs](/guides/video/build-real-time-video-experiences#5-integrate-a-real-time-video-sdk).

    [Real-Time Video guides](/guides/video/build-real-time-video-experiences).

    An asset refers to a piece of media content that is stored or is being live streamed through the Mux system. An asset always has a duration and one or more tracks (audio, video, and text data).

    The media content of an asset cannot be updated once created, however an asset can be used to create another asset, and can be modified within that process.
  name: Assets
- description: |-
    A Live Stream represents a unique live stream of video being pushed to Mux. It includes configuration details (a Stream Key) for live broadcasting software/hardware and a Playback ID for playing the stream anywhere. Currently, RTMP is the only supported method of ingesting video. Use rtmp://global-live.mux.com:5222/app with the Live Stream's Stream Key for getting the video into Mux, and use https://stream.mux.com with the Live Stream's Playback ID for playback.

    A Live Stream can be used once for a specific event, or re-used forever. If you're building an application like Facebook Live or Twitch, you could create one Live Stream per user. This allows them to configure their broadcasting software once, and the Live Stream Playback ID will always show their latest stream.

    Each RTMP session creates a new video asset automatically. You can set up a webhook to be notified each time a broadcast (or Live Stream RTMP session) begins or ends with the video.live_stream.active and video.live_stream.idle events respectively. Assets that are created from a Live Stream have the same behavior as other Assets you create.

- description: "A URL signing key is used as the secret when signing any Mux URL.\
    \ Mux requires a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) as the value of the token query\
    \ parameter. The token query parameter must be set for URLs that reference a playback\
    \ ID with a signed playback policy."

    Direct upload allows you to push assets directly to Mux storage instead of needing to go through your own first. When you create a new direct upload, we'll give you back a signed URL for a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Their storage API is S3 compatible, so whatever tool you use to upload to either GCS or S3 should work, just remember you're probably uploading large video files and should [take advantage of things like resumable or multipart uploads](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/how-tos/resumable-upload).

    Particularly for customers that deal with a lot of user-generated content, it's common to expect quite a few abandoned uploads. To keep those abandoned uploads from cluttering up your asset lists, we don't create an asset for you until the upload is complete. Once that asset is created, you can expect all of the normal asset-related webhooks.

    The Delivery Usage API allows you to get delivery/streaming usage details for each asset and across all assets. Delivery usage details are aggregated every hour at the top of the hour and can be requested for a specified time window within the last 90 days starting at 12 hours prior to when the request is made.

    Assets are ordered by delivery usage starting with the one with the highest usage. Only assets with delivery usage greater than 0 seconds are returned in the response.

    Historical metrics are used for tracking KPIs, diagnosing issues, and
    measuring viewers' quality of experience. Metrics are calculated using the
    video views that have been completed and are bucketed on the view end time
    for quality of experience metrics and view start time for engagement
    metrics. Historical metrics provide a large collection of dimensions that
    can be used to aggregate quality of experience based on view metadata. You
    can also easily compare experiences across viewer populations to, for
    example, find issues with specific devices or geographies.

    Historical metrics are similar but not directly comparable to the real-time
    metrics in the Real-time APIs. These metrics are aggregated for long-term
    storage historical reporting and are generated using different viewer
    populations.
  name: Metrics
- description: |
    Monitoring metrics are used for operational monitoring of a video platform.
    The metrics are aggregated in five second intervals, across the views that
    are currently being watched. The real-time metrics' timeline, breakdown,
    and histogram representations are available via the APIs.

    Monitoring metrics are similar but not directly comparable to the historical
    metrics in the Metrics APIs. These metrics are aggregated to provide the most
    operational detail possible used for resolving operational issues.

        (Optional) End the live stream recording immediately instead of waiting for the reconnect_window. `EXT-X-ENDLIST` tag is added to the HLS manifest which notifies the player that this live stream is over.

        Mux does not close the encoder connection immediately. Encoders are often configured to re-establish connections immediately which would result in a new recorded asset. For this reason, Mux waits for 60s before closing the connection with the encoder. This 60s timeframe is meant to give encoder operators a chance to disconnect from their end.

        Mux also closes the encoder connection immediately. Any attempt from the encoder to re-establish connection will fail till the live stream is re-enabled.

Defaults to 60 seconds on the API if not specified.

            If not specified directly, Standard Latency streams have a Reconnect Window of 60 seconds; Reduced and Low Latency streams have a default of 0 seconds, or no Reconnect Window. For that reason, we suggest specifying a value other than zero for Reduced and Low Latency streams.

            Reduced and Low Latency streams with a Reconnect Window greater than zero will insert slate media into the recorded asset while waiting for the streaming software to reconnect or when there are brief interruptions in the live stream media. When using a Reconnect Window setting higher than 60 seconds with a Standard Latency stream, we highly recommend enabling slate with the `use_slate_for_standard_latency` option.

            * For `audio` tracks, the URL is the location of the audio file for Mux to download, for example an M4A, WAV, or MP3 file. Mux supports most audio file formats and codecs, but for fastest processing, you should [use standard inputs wherever possible](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/minimize-processing-time).
            * For `text` tracks, the URL is the location of subtitle/captions file. Mux supports [SubRip Text (SRT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) and [Web Video Text Tracks](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/) formats for ingesting Subtitles and Closed Captions.

Mux supports most audio/video file formats and codecs, but for fastest processing, you should [use standard inputs wherever possible](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/minimize-processing-time).
            * For `audio` tracks, the URL is the location of the audio file for Mux to download, for example an M4A, WAV, or MP3 file. Mux supports most audio file formats and codecs, but for fastest processing, you should [use standard inputs wherever possible](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/minimize-processing-time).
            * For `text` tracks, the URL is the location of subtitle/captions file. Mux supports [SubRip Text (SRT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) and [Web Video Text Tracks](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/) formats for ingesting Subtitles and Closed Captions.
            * For Watermarking or Overlay, the URL is the location of the watermark image.
            * When creating clips from existing Mux assets, the URL is defined with `mux://assets/{asset_id}` template where `asset_id` is the Asset Identifier for creating the clip from.
            The url property may be omitted on the first input object when providing asset settings for LiveStream and Upload objects, in order to configure settings related to the primary (live stream or direct upload) input.

            When live streaming software disconnects from Mux, either intentionally or due to a drop in the network, the Reconnect Window is the time in seconds that Mux should wait for the streaming software to reconnect before considering the live stream finished and completing the recorded asset. **Max**: 1800s (30 minutes).

            If not specified directly, Standard Latency streams have a Reconnect Window of 60 seconds; Reduced and Low Latency streams have a default of 0 seconds, or no Reconnect Window. For that reason, we suggest specifying a value other than zero for Reduced and Low Latency streams.

            Reduced and Low Latency streams with a Reconnect Window greater than zero will insert slate media into the recorded asset while waiting for the streaming software to reconnect or when there are brief interruptions in the live stream media. When using a Reconnect Window setting higher than 60 seconds with a Standard Latency stream, we highly recommend enabling slate with the `use_slate_for_standard_latency` option.

            If not specified directly, Standard Latency streams have a Reconnect Window of 60 seconds; Reduced and Low Latency streams have a default of 0 seconds, or no Reconnect Window. For that reason, we suggest specifying a value other than zero for Reduced and Low Latency streams.

            Reduced and Low Latency streams with a Reconnect Window greater than zero will insert slate media into the recorded asset while waiting for the streaming software to reconnect or when there are brief interruptions in the live stream media. When using a Reconnect Window setting higher than 60 seconds with a Standard Latency stream, we highly recommend enabling slate with the `use_slate_for_standard_latency` option.
