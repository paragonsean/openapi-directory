## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**availableProducts** | [**[Products]**](Products.md) | A list of products available for the Item that have not yet been accessed. The contents of this array will be mutually exclusive with &#x60;billed_products&#x60;. | 
**billedProducts** | [**[Products]**](Products.md) | A list of products that have been billed for the Item. The contents of this array will be mutually exclusive with &#x60;available_products&#x60;. Note - &#x60;billed_products&#x60; is populated in all environments but only requests in Production are billed. Also note that products that are billed on a pay-per-call basis rather than a pay-per-Item basis, such as &#x60;balance&#x60;, will not appear here.  | 
**consentExpirationTime** | **Date** | The RFC 3339 timestamp after which the consent provided by the end user will expire. Upon consent expiration, the item will enter the &#x60;ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED&#x60; error state. To circumvent the &#x60;ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED&#x60; error and maintain continuous consent, the end user can reauthenticate via Linkâ€™s update mode in advance of the consent expiration time.  Note - This is only relevant for certain OAuth-based institutions. For all other institutions, this field will be null.  | 
**consentedProducts** | [**[Products]**](Products.md) | Beta: A list of products that have gone through consent collection for the Item. Only present for those enabled in the beta.  | [optional]

**itemId** | **String** | The Plaid Item ID. The &#x60;item_id&#x60; is always unique; linking the same account at the same institution twice will result in two Items with different &#x60;item_id&#x60; values. Like all Plaid identifiers, the &#x60;item_id&#x60; is case-sensitive. | 
**products** | [**[Products]**](Products.md) | A list of authorized products for the Item.  | [optional]

**webhook** | **String** | The URL registered to receive webhooks for the Item. |
