     * Asset information about an account
     * @alias module:model/AccountAssets
     * @implements module:model/AccountBase
     * @param accountId {String} Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.
     * @param balances {module:model/AccountBalance} 
     * @param mask {String} The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of an account's official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item's accounts, and it may also not match the mask that the bank displays to the user.
     * @param name {String} The name of the account, either assigned by the user or by the financial institution itself
     * @param officialName {String} The official name of the account as given by the financial institution
     * @param subtype {module:model/AccountSubtype} 
     * @param type {module:model/AccountType} 
     * @param daysAvailable {Number} The duration of transaction history available for this Item, typically defined as the time since the date of the earliest transaction in that account. Only returned by Assets endpoints.
     * @param historicalBalances {Array.<module:model/HistoricalBalance>} Calculated data about the historical balances on the account. Only returned by Assets endpoints and currently not supported by `brokerage` or `investment` accounts.
     * @param owners {Array.<module:model/Owner>} Data returned by the financial institution about the account owner or owners. Only returned by Identity or Assets endpoints. For business accounts, the name reported may be either the name of the individual or the name of the business, depending on the institution. Multiple owners on a single account will be represented in the same `owner` object, not in multiple owner objects within the array. In API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier, the `owners` object is not returned, and instead identity information is returned in the top level `identity` object. For more details, see [Plaid API versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2019-05-29)
     * @param transactions {Array.<module:model/AssetReportTransaction>} Transaction history associated with the account. Only returned by Assets endpoints. Transaction history returned by endpoints such as `/transactions/get` or `/investments/transactions/get` will be returned in the top-level `transactions` field instead.
