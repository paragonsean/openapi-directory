 * OAIPaymentInitiationPaymentStatus.h
 *
 * The status of the payment.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_INPUT_NEEDED&#x60;: This is the initial state of all payments. It indicates that the payment is waiting on user input to continue processing. A payment may re-enter this state later on if further input is needed.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED&#x60;: The payment has been successfully authorised and accepted by the financial institution but has not been executed.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS&#x60;: The payment has failed due to insufficient funds.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_FAILED&#x60;: The payment has failed to be initiated. This error is retryable once the root cause is resolved.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_BLOCKED&#x60;: The payment has been blocked. This is a retryable error.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_AUTHORISING&#x60;: The payment is currently being processed. The payment will automatically exit this state when the financial institution has authorised the transaction.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_CANCELLED&#x60;: The payment was cancelled during authorisation.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED&#x60;: The payment has been successfully executed and is considered complete.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED&#x60;: The payment has settled and funds are available for use. Payment settlement can only be guaranteed by using Plaid virtual accounts. A payment will typically settle within seconds to several days, depending on which payment rail is used.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_ESTABLISHED&#x60;: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established. This state is only used for standing orders.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_REJECTED&#x60;: The payment was rejected by the financial institution.  Deprecated: These statuses will be removed in a future release.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_UNKNOWN&#x60;: The payment status is unknown.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_PROCESSING&#x60;: The payment is currently being processed. The payment will automatically exit this state when processing is complete.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_COMPLETED&#x60;: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established. This state is only used for standing orders.
