However, new members are allowed a grace period of additional daily matches. Each time you choose to meet or mute one of your algorithmic matches, a new match is introduced.

Upon doing so, if they aren&#39;t already, they will automatically be connected with you as well. If your current access token does not escape the bubble, the invitation will specify you wish to connect within the application&#39;s name. If your current access token escapes the bubble, the invitation will specify you wish to connect within Dazah. Submit either a list of emails, or a LinkedIn or Outlook CSV file. You can retrieve your LinkedIn CSV file by exporting your LinkedIn Connections at https://www.linkedin.com/people/export-settings. You can retrieve your Outlook CSV file by using the Outlook Import and Export Wizard. This endpoint buckets the invitations into four categories: Existing invites are existing users who are already connected with you within the current bubble, and are therefore not emailed; Discovered invites are existing Dazah users who are available to be connected with within the current bubble, and are therefore not emailed. Now that they have been discovered, the users/{:ID}/meet API endpoint may be used to connect with them; Invalid invites are existing Dazah users who are unavailable to be connected with, because they have deactivated accounts, are muting you, etc., and are therefore not emailed; Emailed invites are queued to receive an invitation within approximately 1 hour. Note that if you are attempting to invite an existing Dazah user who does not currently exist within your current access token&#39;s bubble, they will fall within the Discovered bucket if your current access token escapes the bubble, but will be emailed an invitation to join the application if your current access token does not escape the bubble.
