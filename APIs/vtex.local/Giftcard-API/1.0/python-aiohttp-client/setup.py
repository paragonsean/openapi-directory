    &gt;ℹ️ Onboarding guide  &gt;  &gt; Check the new [Payments onboarding guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/payments-overview). We created this guide to improve the onboarding experience for developers at VTEX. It assembles all documentation on our Developer Portal about Payments and is organized by focusing on the developer&#39;s journey.    The Gift Card is a payment method configured as a cash value associated with a client. It is used to grant a discount on the value of the order at the store.    &gt; ⚠ A Gift Card works as a **payment method**, not a promotion.
