# PlaceOrderRequestClientProfileData

Customer's profile information. The `email` functions as a customer's ID.    For customers already in your database, sending only the email address is enough to register the order to the shopperâ€™s existing account.    > If the shopper exists in you database but is not logged in, sending other profile information along with the email will cause the platform to fail placing the order. This happens because this action is interpreted as an attempt to edit profile data, which is not possible unless the customer is logged in to the store.
