    \ Notifications\n\nIPN (Instant payment notifications, or callbacks) are used\
    \ to notify you when transaction status is changed.  \nTo use them, you should\
    \ complete the following steps:\n\n1.  Generate and save the IPN Secret key in\
    \ Store Settings tab at the Dashboard.\n2.  Insert your URL address where you\
    \ want to get callbacks in create_payment request. The parameter name is ipn_callback_url.\
    \ You will receive payment updates (statuses) to this URL address.\n3.  You will\
    \ receive all the parameters at the URL address you specified in (2) by POST request.\
    \  \n    The POST request will contain the *x-nowpayments-sig* parameter in the\
    \ header.  \n    The body of the request is similiar to a [get payment status](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7907941/S1a32n38?version=latest#0b77a8e3-2344-4760-a0bd-247da067db6d)\
    \ response body.  \n    Example:  \n    {\"payment_id\":5077125051,\"payment_status\"\
    :\"waiting\",\"pay_address\":\"0xd1cDE08A07cD25adEbEd35c3867a59228C09B606\",\"\
    price_amount\":170,\"price_currency\":\"usd\",\"pay_amount\":155.38559757,\"actually_paid\"\
    :0,\"pay_currency\":\"mana\",\"order_id\":\"2\",\"order_description\":\"Apple\
    \ Macbook Pro 2019 x 1\",\"purchase_id\":\"6084744717\",\"created_at\":\"2021-04-12T14:22:54.942Z\"\
    ,\"updated_at\":\"2021-04-12T14:23:06.244Z\",\"outcome_amount\":1131.7812095,\"\
    outcome_currency\":\"trx\"}\n4.  Sort all the parameters from the POST request\
    \ in alphabetical order.\n5.  Convert them to string using  \n    [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify)\
    \ (params, Object.keys(params).sort()) or the same function.\n6.  Sign a string\
    \ with an IPN-secret key with HMAC and sha-512 key\n7.  Compare the signed string\
    \ from the previous step with the x-nowpayments-sig , which is stored in the header\
    \ of the callback request.  \n    If these strings are similar it is a success.\
    \  \n    Otherwise, contact us on [support@nowpayments.io](mailto:support@nowpayments.io)\
    \ to solve the problem.\n    \n\nExample of creating a signed string at Node.JS\n\
    \n```\nconst hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha512', notificationsKey);\nhmac.update(JSON.stringify(params,\
    \ Object.keys(params).sort()));\nconst signature = hmac.digest('hex');\n\n```\n\
    \nExample of comparing signed strings in PHP\n\n```\nfunction check_ipn_request_is_valid()\n\
    \    {\n        $error_msg = \"Unknown error\";\n        $auth_ok = false;\n \
    \       $request_data = null;\n        if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG'])\
    \ && !empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG'])) {\n            $recived_hmac\
    \ = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG'];\n            $request_json = file_get_contents('php://input');\n\
    \            $request_data = json_decode($request_json, true);\n            ksort($request_data);\n\
    \            $sorted_request_json = json_encode($request_data, JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES);\n\
    \            if ($request_json !== false && !empty($request_json)) {\n       \
    \         $hmac = hash_hmac(\"sha512\", $sorted_request_json, trim($this->ipn_secret));\n\
    \                if ($hmac == $recived_hmac) {\n                    $auth_ok =\
    \ true;\n                } else {\n                    $error_msg = 'HMAC signature\
    \ does not match';\n                }\n            } else {\n                $error_msg\
    \ = 'Error reading POST data';\n            }\n        } else {\n            $error_msg\
    \ = 'No HMAC signature sent.';\n        }\n    }\n\n```\n\n## Recurrent payment\
    \ notifications\n\nIf an error is detected, the payment is flagged and will receive\
    \ additional recurrent notifications (number of recurrent notifications can be\
    \ changed in your Store Settings-> Instant Payment Notifications).\n\nIf an error\
    \ is received again during processing of the payment, recurrent notifications\
    \ will be initiated again.\n\nExample: \"Timeout\" is set to 1 minute and \"Number\
    \ of recurrent notifications\" is set to 3.\n\nOnce an error is detected, you\
    \ will receive 3 notifications at 1 minute intervals.\n\n## Several payments for\
    \ one order\n\nIf you want to create several payments for one Order you should\
    \ do the following:\n\n*   Create a payment for the full order amount.\n*   Save\
    \ \"purchase_id\" which will be in \"create_payment\" response\n*   Create next\
    \ payment or payments with this \"purchase_id\" in \"create_payment\" request.\n\
    *   **Only works for partially_paid payments**\n    \n\nIt may be useful if you\
    \ want to give your customers opportunity to pay a full order with several payments,\
    \ for example, one part in BTC and one part in ETH. Also, if your customer accidentally\
    \ paid you only part of a full amount, you can automatically ask them to make\
    \ another payment.\n\n## Packages\n\nPlease find our out-of-the box packages for\
    \ easy integration below:\n\n[JavaScript package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nowpaymentsio/nowpayments-api-js)\n\
    \n\\[PHP package\\]  \n([https://packagist.org/packages/nowpayments/nowpayments-api-php](https://packagist.org/packages/nowpayments/nowpayments-api-php))\n\

        Get the minimum payment amount for a specific pair.

        You can provide both currencies in the pair or just currency\_from, and we will calculate the minimum payment amount for currency\_from and currency which you have specified as the outcome in the Store Settings.

        You can also specify one of the fiat currencies in the currency\_from. In this case, the minimum payment will be calculated in this fiat currency.

        You can also add field fiat\_equivalent (optional field) to get the fiat equivalent of the minimum amount.

        In the case of several outcome wallets we will calculate the minimum amount in the same way we route your payment to a specific wallet.
