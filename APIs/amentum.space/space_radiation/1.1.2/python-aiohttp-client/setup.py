    Space has a hostile radiation environment that increases the risk of cancers in humans and malfunctions in spacecraft electronics. The types of space  radiation of primary concern are:   &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;         Galactic Cosmic Rays from outside our solar system generated by          supernovae and other phenomena;     &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;         Solar Energetic Particles produced by the Sun during intense and         sporadic bursts of activity; and     &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;         Trapped Radiation: energetic particles confined by Earth&#39;s magnetic         field, usually comprising an inner belt of mostly high energy protons          and an outer belt dominated by lower energy electrons and plasma.     &lt;/li&gt;   &lt;/ul&gt;   Understanding the space radiation environment for a particular mission profile is becoming increasingly important. Commercial off-the-shelf electronic components  that aren&#39;t resilient to space radiation are now prevalent. Longer duration  missions to cislunar space, Mars, and beyond are placing astronauts at greater  risk of radiation exposure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; API requests must contain a key \&quot;API-Key\&quot; in the header (see code samples).
