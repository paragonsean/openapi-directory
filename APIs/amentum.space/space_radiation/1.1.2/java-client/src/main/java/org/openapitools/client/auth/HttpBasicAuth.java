/*
 * Space Radiation API
 * Space has a hostile radiation environment that increases the risk of cancers in humans and malfunctions in spacecraft electronics. The types of space  radiation of primary concern are:   <ul>     <li>         Galactic Cosmic Rays from outside our solar system generated by          supernovae and other phenomena;     </li>     <li>         Solar Energetic Particles produced by the Sun during intense and         sporadic bursts of activity; and     </li>     <li>         Trapped Radiation: energetic particles confined by Earth's magnetic         field, usually comprising an inner belt of mostly high energy protons          and an outer belt dominated by lower energy electrons and plasma.     </li>   </ul>   Understanding the space radiation environment for a particular mission profile is becoming increasingly important. Commercial off-the-shelf electronic components  that aren't resilient to space radiation are now prevalent. Longer duration  missions to cislunar space, Mars, and beyond are placing astronauts at greater  risk of radiation exposure. <br><br> API requests must contain a key \"API-Key\" in the header (see code samples).
