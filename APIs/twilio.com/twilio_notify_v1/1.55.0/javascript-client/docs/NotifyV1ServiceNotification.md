## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**accountSid** | **String** | The SID of the [Account](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api/account) that created the Notification resource. | [optional] 
**action** | **String** | The actions to display for the notification. For APNS, translates to the &#x60;aps.category&#x60; value. For GCM, translates to the &#x60;data.twi_action&#x60; value. For SMS, this parameter is not supported and is omitted from deliveries to those channels. | [optional] 
**alexa** | **Object** | Deprecated. | [optional] 
**apn** | **Object** | The APNS-specific payload that overrides corresponding attributes in the generic payload for APNS Bindings. This property maps to the APNS &#x60;Payload&#x60; item, therefore the &#x60;aps&#x60; key must be used to change standard attributes. Adds custom key-value pairs to the root of the dictionary. See the [APNS documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CommunicatingwithAPNs.html) for more details. We reserve keys that start with &#x60;twi_&#x60; for future use. Custom keys that start with &#x60;twi_&#x60; are not allowed. | [optional] 
**body** | **String** | The notification text. For FCM and GCM, translates to &#x60;data.twi_body&#x60;. For APNS, translates to &#x60;aps.alert.body&#x60;. For SMS, translates to &#x60;body&#x60;. SMS requires either this &#x60;body&#x60; value, or &#x60;media_urls&#x60; attribute defined in the &#x60;sms&#x60; parameter of the notification. | [optional] 
**data** | **Object** | The custom key-value pairs of the notification&#39;s payload. For FCM and GCM, this value translates to &#x60;data&#x60; in the FCM and GCM payloads. FCM and GCM [reserve certain keys](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref) that cannot be used in those channels. For APNS, attributes of &#x60;data&#x60; are inserted into the APNS payload as custom properties outside of the &#x60;aps&#x60; dictionary. In all channels, we reserve keys that start with &#x60;twi_&#x60; for future use. Custom keys that start with &#x60;twi_&#x60; are not allowed and are rejected as 400 Bad request with no delivery attempted. For SMS, this parameter is not supported and is omitted from deliveries to those channels. | [optional] 
**dateCreated** | **Date** | The date and time in GMT when the resource was created specified in [RFC 2822](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt) format. | [optional] 
**facebookMessenger** | **Object** | Deprecated. | [optional] 
**fcm** | **Object** | The FCM-specific payload that overrides corresponding attributes in the generic payload for FCM Bindings. This property maps to the root JSON dictionary. See the [FCM documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref#downstream) for more details. Target parameters &#x60;to&#x60;, &#x60;registration_ids&#x60;, &#x60;condition&#x60;, and &#x60;notification_key&#x60; are not allowed in this parameter. We reserve keys that start with &#x60;twi_&#x60; for future use. Custom keys that start with &#x60;twi_&#x60; are not allowed. FCM also [reserves certain keys](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref), which cannot be used in that channel. | [optional] 
**gcm** | **Object** | The GCM-specific payload that overrides corresponding attributes in the generic payload for GCM Bindings.  This property maps to the root JSON dictionary. Target parameters &#x60;to&#x60;, &#x60;registration_ids&#x60;, and &#x60;notification_key&#x60; are not allowed. We reserve keys that start with &#x60;twi_&#x60; for future use. Custom keys that start with &#x60;twi_&#x60; are not allowed. | [optional] 
**identities** | **[String]** | The list of &#x60;identity&#x60; values of the Users to notify. We will attempt to deliver notifications only to Bindings with an identity in this list. | [optional]

Each attribute in this value maps to the corresponding &#x60;form&#x60; parameter of the Twilio [Message](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api/message-resource) resource.  These parameters of the Message resource are supported in snake case format: &#x60;body&#x60;, &#x60;media_urls&#x60;, &#x60;status_callback&#x60;, and &#x60;max_price&#x60;.  The &#x60;status_callback&#x60; parameter overrides the corresponding parameter in the messaging service, if configured. The &#x60;media_urls&#x60; property expects a JSON array. | [optional]

SMS does not support this property. | [optional]
