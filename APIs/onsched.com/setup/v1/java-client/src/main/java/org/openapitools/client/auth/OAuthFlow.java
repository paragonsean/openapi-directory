 * OnSched Setup API
 * Build secure and scalable custom apps for onboarding and setup. Our flexible API provides many options for configuration.  <br><br>  Take the API for a test drive. Just click on the Authorize button below and authenticate.   You can access our demo company profile if you are not a customer, or your own profile by using your assigned ClientId and Secret.  <br><br>  The API has two interfaces, consumer and setup.   <ul>  <li>  The consumer interface provides all the endpoints required for implementing consumer booking flows.  </li>  <li>  The setup interface provides endpoints for profile configuration and setup.  </li>  </ul>  Toggle freely between the two interfaces using the swagger tool bar option labelled 'Select a definition'.
