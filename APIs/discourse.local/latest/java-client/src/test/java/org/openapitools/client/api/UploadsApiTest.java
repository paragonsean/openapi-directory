 * Discourse API Documentation
 * This page contains the documentation on how to use Discourse through API calls.  > Note: For any endpoints not listed you can follow the [reverse engineer the Discourse API](https://meta.discourse.org/t/-/20576) guide to figure out how to use an API endpoint.  ### Request Content-Type  The Content-Type for POST and PUT requests can be set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `application/json`.  ### Endpoint Names and Response Content-Type  Most API endpoints provide the same content as their HTML counterparts. For example the URL `/categories` serves a list of categories, the `/categories.json` API provides the same information in JSON format.  Instead of sending API requests to `/categories.json` you may also send them to `/categories` and add an `Accept: application/json` header to the request to get the JSON response. Sending requests with the `Accept` header is necessary if you want to use URLs for related endpoints returned by the API, such as pagination URLs. These URLs are returned without the `.json` prefix so you need to add the header in order to get the correct response format.  ### Authentication  Some endpoints do not require any authentication, pretty much anything else will require you to be authenticated.  To become authenticated you will need to create an API Key from the admin panel.  Once you have your API Key you can pass it in along with your API Username as an HTTP header like this:  ``` curl -X GET \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin/users/list/active.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: 714552c6148e1617aeab526d0606184b94a80ec048fc09894ff1a72b740c5f19\" \\ -H \"Api-Username: system\" ```  and this is how POST requests will look:  ``` curl -X POST \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/categories\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data;\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: 714552c6148e1617aeab526d0606184b94a80ec048fc09894ff1a72b740c5f19\" \\ -H \"Api-Username: system\" \\ -F \"name=89853c20-4409-e91a-a8ea-f6cdff96aaaa\" \\ -F \"color=49d9e9\" \\ -F \"text_color=f0fcfd\" ```  ### Boolean values  If an endpoint accepts a boolean be sure to specify it as a lowercase `true` or `false` value unless noted otherwise.

    /**
     * Generates batches of presigned URLs for multipart parts
     *
     * Multipart uploads are uploaded in chunks or parts to individual presigned URLs, similar to the one generated by /generate-presigned-put. The part numbers provided must be between 1 and 10000. The total number of parts will depend on the chunk size in bytes that you intend to use to upload each chunk. For example a 12MB file may have 2 5MB chunks and a final 2MB chunk, for part numbers 1, 2, and 3.  This endpoint will return a presigned URL for each part number provided, which you can then use to send PUT requests for the binary chunk corresponding to that part. When the part is uploaded, the provider should return an ETag for the part, and this should be stored along with the part number, because this is needed to complete the multipart upload.
