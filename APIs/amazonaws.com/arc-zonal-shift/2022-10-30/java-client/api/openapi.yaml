  description: "<p>This is the API Reference Guide for the zonal shift feature of\
    \ Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller. This guide is for developers\
    \ who need detailed information about zonal shift API actions, data types, and\
    \ errors.</p> <p>Zonal shift is in preview release for Amazon Route 53 Application\
    \ Recovery Controller and is subject to change.</p> <p>Zonal shift in Route 53\
    \ ARC enables you to move traffic for a load balancer resource away from an Availability\
    \ Zone. Starting a zonal shift helps your application recover immediately, for\
    \ example, from a developer's bad code deployment or from an AWS infrastructure\
    \ failure in a single Availability Zone, reducing the impact and time lost from\
    \ an issue in one zone. </p> <p>Supported AWS resources are automatically registered\
    \ with Route 53 ARC. Resources that are registered for zonal shifts in Route 53\
    \ ARC are managed resources in Route 53 ARC. You can start a zonal shift for any\
    \ managed resource in your account in a Region. At this time, you can only start\
    \ a zonal shift for Network Load Balancers and Application Load Balancers with\
    \ cross-zone load balancing turned off.</p> <p>Zonal shifts are temporary. You\
    \ must specify an expiration when you start a zonal shift, of up to three days\
    \ initially. If you want to still keep traffic away from an Availability Zone,\
    \ you can update the zonal shift and set a new expiration. You can also cancel\
    \ a zonal shift, before it expires, for example, if you're ready to restore traffic\
    \ to the Availability Zone.</p> <p>For more information about using zonal shift,\
    \ see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/what-is-route53-recovery.html\"\
    >Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide</a>.</p>"
