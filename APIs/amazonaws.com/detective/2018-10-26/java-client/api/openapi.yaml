  description: "<p>Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations\
    \ to help you to analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web\
    \ Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based\
    \ events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from CloudTrail\
    \ and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings\
    \ detected by Amazon GuardDuty.</p> <p>The Detective API primarily supports the\
    \ creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted\
    \ data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator\
    \ account.</p> <p>To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator\
    \ account sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the invitation,\
    \ it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.</p> <p>Detective is also\
    \ integrated with Organizations. The organization management account designates\
    \ the Detective administrator account for the organization. That account becomes\
    \ the administrator account for the organization behavior graph. The Detective\
    \ administrator account is also the delegated administrator account for Detective\
    \ in Organizations.</p> <p>The Detective administrator account can enable any\
    \ organization account as a member account in the organization behavior graph.\
    \ The organization accounts do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator\
    \ account can also invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph.</p>\
    \ <p>Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to\
    \ manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the\
    \ currently selected endpoint.</p> <p>The administrator account for a behavior\
    \ graph can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Enable\
    \ and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.</p>\
    \ </li> <li> <p>View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.</p> </li>\
    \ <li> <p>Add member accounts to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove member\
    \ accounts from a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Apply tags to a behavior graph.</p>\
    \ </li> </ul> <p>The organization management account can use the Detective API\
    \ to select the delegated administrator for Detective.</p> <p>The Detective administrator\
    \ account for an organization can use the Detective API to do the following:</p>\
    \ <ul> <li> <p>Perform all of the functions of an administrator account.</p> </li>\
    \ <li> <p>Determine whether to automatically enable new organization accounts\
    \ as member accounts in the organization behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>An\
    \ invited member account can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul>\
    \ <li> <p>View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.</p> </li>\
    \ <li> <p>Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li>\
    \ <p>Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove\
    \ their account from a behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All API actions are\
    \ logged as CloudTrail events. See <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html\"\
    >Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail</a>.</p> <note> <p>We replaced the\
    \ term \"master account\" with the term \"administrator account.\" An administrator\
    \ account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In the case of Detective,\
    \ the administrator account manages the accounts in their behavior graph.</p>\
