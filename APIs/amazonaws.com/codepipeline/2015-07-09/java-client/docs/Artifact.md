# Artifact

Artifacts are the files that are worked on by actions in the pipeline. See the action configuration for each action for details about artifact parameters. For example, the S3 source action artifact is a file name (or file path), and the files are generally provided as a ZIP file. Example artifact name: SampleApp_Windows.zip
