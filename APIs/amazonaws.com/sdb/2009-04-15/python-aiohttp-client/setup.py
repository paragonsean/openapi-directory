    Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and effort associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB provides developers the freedom to focus on application development. &lt;p&gt; A traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically simpler, requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and providing a simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and performance tuning. Developers gain access to this functionality within Amazon&#39;s proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and pay only for what they use. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Visit &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/\&quot;&gt;http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/&lt;/a&gt; for more information. &lt;/p&gt;
