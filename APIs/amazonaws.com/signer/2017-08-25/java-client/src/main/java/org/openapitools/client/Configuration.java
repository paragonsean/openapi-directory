 * AWS Signer
 * <p>AWS Signer is a fully managed code signing service to help you ensure the trust and integrity of your code. </p> <p>AWS Signer supports the following applications:</p> <p>With code signing for AWS Lambda, you can sign <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/\">AWS Lambda</a> deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/\">Amazon S3</a>, <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/\">Amazon CloudWatch</a>, and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/\">AWS CloudTrail</a>. In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and then use Signer to sign Lambda zip files in S3. </p> <p>With code signing for IoT, you can sign code for any IoT device that is supported by AWS. IoT code signing is available for <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/\">Amazon FreeRTOS</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/\">AWS IoT Device Management</a>, and is integrated with <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/\">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a>. In order to sign code, you import a third-party code signing certificate using ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management. </p> <p>With code signing for containers â€¦(TBD)</p> <p>For more information about AWS Signer, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html\">AWS Signer Developer Guide</a>.</p>
