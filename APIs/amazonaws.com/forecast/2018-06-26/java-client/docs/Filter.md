# Filter

Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter consists of a condition and a match statement. The condition is either <code>IS</code> or <code>IS_NOT</code>, which specifies whether to include or exclude the objects that match the statement, respectively. The match statement consists of a key and a value.
