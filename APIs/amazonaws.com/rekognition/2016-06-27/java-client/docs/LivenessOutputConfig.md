# LivenessOutputConfig

Contains settings that specify the location of an Amazon S3 bucket used to store the output of a Face Liveness session. Note that the S3 bucket must be located in the caller's AWS account and in the same region as the Face Liveness end-point. Additionally, the Amazon S3 object keys are auto-generated by the Face Liveness system.
