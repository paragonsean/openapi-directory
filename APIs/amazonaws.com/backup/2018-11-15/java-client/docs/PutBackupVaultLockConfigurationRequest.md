## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**minRetentionDays** | **Integer** | &lt;p&gt;The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the minimum retention period that the vault retains its recovery points. This setting can be useful if, for example, your organization&#39;s policies require you to retain certain data for at least seven years (2555 days).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If this parameter is not specified, Vault Lock will not enforce a minimum retention period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If this parameter is specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a lifecycle policy with a retention period equal to or longer than the minimum retention period. If the job&#39;s retention period is shorter than that minimum retention period, then the vault fails that backup or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different vault. The shortest minimum retention period you can specify is 1 day. Recovery points already saved in the vault prior to Vault Lock are not affected.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**maxRetentionDays** | **Integer** | &lt;p&gt;The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the maximum retention period that the vault retains its recovery points. This setting can be useful if, for example, your organization&#39;s policies require you to destroy certain data after retaining it for four years (1460 days).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If this parameter is not included, Vault Lock does not enforce a maximum retention period on the recovery points in the vault. If this parameter is included without a value, Vault Lock will not enforce a maximum retention period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If this parameter is specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a lifecycle policy with a retention period equal to or shorter than the maximum retention period. If the job&#39;s retention period is longer than that maximum retention period, then the vault fails the backup or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different vault. The longest maximum retention period you can specify is 36500 days (approximately 100 years). Recovery points already saved in the vault prior to Vault Lock are not affected.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**changeableForDays** | **Integer** | &lt;p&gt;The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the number of days before the lock date. For example, setting &lt;code&gt;ChangeableForDays&lt;/code&gt; to 30 on Jan. 1, 2022 at 8pm UTC will set the lock date to Jan. 31, 2022 at 8pm UTC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backup enforces a 72-hour cooling-off period before Vault Lock takes effect and becomes immutable. Therefore, you must set &lt;code&gt;ChangeableForDays&lt;/code&gt; to 3 or greater.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before the lock date, you can delete Vault Lock from the vault using &lt;code&gt;DeleteBackupVaultLockConfiguration&lt;/code&gt; or change the Vault Lock configuration using &lt;code&gt;PutBackupVaultLockConfiguration&lt;/code&gt;. On and after the lock date, the Vault Lock becomes immutable and cannot be changed or deleted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If this parameter is not specified, you can delete Vault Lock from the vault using &lt;code&gt;DeleteBackupVaultLockConfiguration&lt;/code&gt; or change the Vault Lock configuration using &lt;code&gt;PutBackupVaultLockConfiguration&lt;/code&gt; at any time.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
