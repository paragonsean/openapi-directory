# Tag

A key:value pair associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as \"environment\") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as \"test,\" \"development,\" or \"production\"). You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services resource.
