    Amazon WorkLink is a cloud-based service that provides secure access to internal websites and web apps from iOS and Android phones. In a single step, your users, such as employees, can access internal websites as efficiently as they access any other public website. They enter a URL in their web browser, or choose a link to an internal website in an email. Amazon WorkLink authenticates the user&#39;s access and securely renders authorized internal web content in a secure rendering service in the AWS cloud. Amazon WorkLink doesn&#39;t download or store any internal web content on mobile devices.
