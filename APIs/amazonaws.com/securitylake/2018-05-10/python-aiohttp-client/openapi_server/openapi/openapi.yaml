  description: "<p>Amazon Security Lake is a fully managed security data lake service.\
    \ You can use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from cloud,\
    \ on-premises, and custom sources into a data lake that's stored in your Amazon\
    \ Web Services account. Amazon Web Services Organizations is an account management\
    \ service that lets you consolidate multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into\
    \ an organization that you create and centrally manage. With Organizations, you\
    \ can create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join your organization.\
    \ Security Lake helps you analyze security data for a more complete understanding\
    \ of your security posture across the entire organization. It can also help you\
    \ improve the protection of your workloads, applications, and data.</p> <p>The\
    \ data lake is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and\
    \ you retain ownership over your data.</p> <p>Amazon Security Lake integrates\
    \ with CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user,\
    \ role, or an Amazon Web Services service. In Security Lake, CloudTrail captures\
    \ API calls for Security Lake as events. The calls captured include calls from\
    \ the Security Lake console and code calls to the Security Lake API operations.\
    \ If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events\
    \ to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Security Lake. If you don't configure\
    \ a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console\
    \ in Event history. Using the information collected by CloudTrail you can determine\
    \ the request that was made to Security Lake, the IP address from which the request\
    \ was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details. To\
    \ learn more about Security Lake information in CloudTrail, see the <a href=\"\
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/securitylake-cloudtrail.html\"\
    >Amazon Security Lake User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Security Lake automates the collection\
    \ of security-related log and event data from integrated Amazon Web Services and\
    \ third-party services. It also helps you manage the lifecycle of data with customizable\
    \ retention and replication settings. Security Lake converts ingested data into\
    \ Apache Parquet format and a standard open-source schema called the Open Cybersecurity\
    \ Schema Framework (OCSF).</p> <p>Other Amazon Web Services and third-party services\
    \ can subscribe to the data that's stored in Security Lake for incident response\
    \ and security data analytics.</p>"
