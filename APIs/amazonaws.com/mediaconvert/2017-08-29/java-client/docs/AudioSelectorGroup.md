# AudioSelectorGroup

Use audio selector groups to combine multiple sidecar audio inputs so that you can assign them to a single output audio tab. Note that, if you're working with embedded audio, it's simpler to assign multiple input tracks into a single audio selector rather than use an audio selector group.
