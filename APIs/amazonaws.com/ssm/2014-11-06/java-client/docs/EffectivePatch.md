# EffectivePatch

The <code>EffectivePatch</code> structure defines metadata about a patch along with the approval state of the patch in a particular patch baseline. The approval state includes information about whether the patch is currently approved, due to be approved by a rule, explicitly approved, or explicitly rejected and the date the patch was or will be approved.
