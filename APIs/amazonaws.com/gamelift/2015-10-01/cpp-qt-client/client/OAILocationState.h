 * OAILocationState.h
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A fleet location and its life-cycle state. A location state object might be used to describe a fleet&#39;s remote location or home Region. Life-cycle state tracks the progress of launching the first instance in a new location and preparing it for game hosting, and then removing all instances and deleting the location from the fleet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;NEW&lt;/b&gt; -- A new fleet location has been defined and desired instances is set to 1. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;DOWNLOADING/VALIDATING/BUILDING/ACTIVATING&lt;/b&gt; -- Amazon GameLift is setting up the new fleet location, creating new instances with the game build or Realtime script and starting server processes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/b&gt; -- Hosts can now accept game sessions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;ERROR&lt;/b&gt; -- An error occurred when downloading, validating, building, or activating the fleet location.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;DELETING&lt;/b&gt; -- Hosts are responding to a delete fleet location request.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;TERMINATED&lt;/b&gt; -- The fleet location no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;NOT_FOUND&lt;/b&gt; -- The fleet location was not found. This could be because the custom location was removed or not created. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
