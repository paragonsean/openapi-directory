/*
 * OAIResourceCreationLimitPolicy.h
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that a player can create within a specified span of time. With this policy, you can control players&#39; ability to consume available resources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The policy is evaluated when a player tries to create a new game session. On receiving a &lt;code&gt;CreateGameSession&lt;/code&gt; request, Amazon GameLift checks that the player (identified by &lt;code&gt;CreatorId&lt;/code&gt;) has created fewer than game session limit in the specified time period.&lt;/p&gt;
