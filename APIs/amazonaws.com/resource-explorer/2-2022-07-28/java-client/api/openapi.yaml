  description: "<p>Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a resource search and\
    \ discovery service. By using Resource Explorer, you can explore your resources\
    \ using an internet search engine-like experience. Examples of resources include\
    \ Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances, Amazon Simple Storage\
    \ Service (Amazon S3) buckets, or Amazon DynamoDB tables. You can search for your\
    \ resources using resource metadata like names, tags, and IDs. Resource Explorer\
    \ can search across all of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your account in\
    \ which you turn the service on, to simplify your cross-Region workloads.</p>\
    \ <p>Resource Explorer scans the resources in each of the Amazon Web Services\
    \ Regions in your Amazon Web Services account in which you turn on Resource Explorer.\
    \ Resource Explorer <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-index\"\
    >creates and maintains an index</a> in each Region, with the details of that Region's\
    \ resources.</p> <p>You can <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html\"\
    >search across all of the indexed Regions in your account</a> by designating one\
    \ of your Amazon Web Services Regions to contain the aggregator index for the\
    \ account. When you <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region-turn-on.html\"\
    >promote a local index in a Region to become the aggregator index for the account</a>,\
    \ Resource Explorer automatically replicates the index information from all local\
    \ indexes in the other Regions to the aggregator index. Therefore, the Region\
    \ with the aggregator index has a copy of all resource information for all Regions\
    \ in the account where you turned on Resource Explorer. As a result, views in\
    \ the aggregator index Region include resources from all of the indexed Regions\
    \ in your account.</p> <p>For more information about Amazon Web Services Resource\
    \ Explorer, including how to enable and configure the service, see the <a href=\"\
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/\">Amazon Web Services\
    \ Resource Explorer User Guide</a>.</p>"
