  description: <p>You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features
    by serving them to a specified percentage of your users while you roll out the
    feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide
    when to ramp up traffic to your users. This helps you reduce risk and identify
    unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature.</p> <p>You can also
    conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on evidence and
    data. An experiment can test as many as five variations at once. Evidently collects
    experiment data and analyzes it using statistical methods. It also provides clear
    recommendations about which variations perform better. You can test both user-facing
    features and backend features.</p>
