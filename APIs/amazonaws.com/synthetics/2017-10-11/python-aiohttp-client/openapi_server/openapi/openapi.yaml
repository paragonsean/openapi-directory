  description: "<fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics</fullname> <p>You can use Amazon\
    \ CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your services. You can create and\
    \ manage <i>canaries</i>, which are modular, lightweight scripts that monitor\
    \ your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. You can set up your canaries to\
    \ run 24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help you check the availability\
    \ and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating\
    \ load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. The canaries seamlessly\
    \ integrate with CloudWatch ServiceLens to help you trace the causes of impacted\
    \ nodes in your applications. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html\"\
    >Using ServiceLens to Monitor the Health of Your Applications</a> in the <i>Amazon\
    \ CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Before you create and manage canaries, be\
    \ aware of the security considerations. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html\"\
