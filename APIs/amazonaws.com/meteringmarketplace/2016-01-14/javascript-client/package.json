  "description": "<fullname>AWS Marketplace Metering Service</fullname> <p>This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service API.</p> <p>AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage dimensions.</p> <p>For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html\">AWS Marketplace metering and entitlement API permissions</a> in the <i>AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.</i> </p> <p> <b>Submitting Metering Records</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>MeterUsage</i> - Submits the metering record for an AWS Marketplace product. <code>MeterUsage</code> is called from an EC2 instance or a container running on EKS or ECS.</p> </li> <li> <p> <i>BatchMeterUsage</i> - Submits the metering record for a set of customers. <code>BatchMeterUsage</code> is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Accepting New Customers</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>ResolveCustomer</i> - Called by a SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this API to obtain a <code>CustomerIdentifier</code> along with the <code>CustomerAWSAccountId</code> and <code>ProductCode</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the <code>RegisterUsage</code> operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call <code>RegisterUsage</code>, but you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more information on using the <code>RegisterUsage</code> operation, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html\">Container-Based Products</a>. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <code>BatchMeterUsage</code> API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for records with the <code>eventName</code> of <code>BatchMeterUsage</code>. You can also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see the <i> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html\">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</i> </p>",
