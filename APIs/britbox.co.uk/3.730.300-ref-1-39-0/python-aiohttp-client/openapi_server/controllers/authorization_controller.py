    """generate_device_authorization_code

    Get a generated device authorization code.  This is the first step in the process of authorizing a device by pin code. The device will make a request to this endpoint providing a unique identifier for the device such as a serial number. This endpoint will then return a generated code which is tied to the given device.  The code may subsequently be used to authorize the device to sign in to an account via the &#x60;/account/devices/authorization&#x60; endpoint. Typically this will be from a page presented in the web app under the account section.  Once authorized, the device will then be able to sign in to that account via the &#x60;/authorization/device&#x60; endpoint, without needing to provide the  credentials of the user.
