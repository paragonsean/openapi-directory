    """get_item_media_files

    Get the video files associated with an item given maximum resolution, device type and one or more delivery types.  This endpoint accepts an Account Catalog token, however if when requesting playback files you receive an *403 status code with error code 1* then the file you&#39;re requesting is classification restricted. This means you should switch to target the &#x60;/account/items/{id}/videos-guarded&#x60; endpoint, passing it an Account Playback token. If not already obtained, this token can be requested via the &#x60;/itv/pinauthorization&#x60; endpoint with an account level pin.  For convenience you may also access free / public files through this endpoint instead of the /items/{id}/videos endpoint, when authenticated.  Returns an array of video file objects which each include a url to a video.  The first entry in the array contains what is predicted to be the best match. The remainder of the entries, if any, may contain resolutions below what was requests. For example if you request HD-720 the response may also contain SD entries.  If you specify multiple delivery types, then the response array will insert types in the order you specify them in the query. For example &#x60;stream,progressive&#x60; would return an array with 0 or more stream files followed by 0 or more progressive files.  If no files are found a 404 is returned.
