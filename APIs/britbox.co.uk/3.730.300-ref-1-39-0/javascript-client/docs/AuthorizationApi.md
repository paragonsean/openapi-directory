## generateDeviceAuthorizationCode

> DeviceAuthorizationCode generateDeviceAuthorizationCode(deviceRegistrationRequest, opts)



Get a generated device authorization code.  This is the first step in the process of authorizing a device by pin code. The device will make a request to this endpoint providing a unique identifier for the device such as a serial number. This endpoint will then return a generated code which is tied to the given device.  The code may subsequently be used to authorize the device to sign in to an account via the &#x60;/account/devices/authorization&#x60; endpoint. Typically this will be from a page presented in the web app under the account section.  Once authorized, the device will then be able to sign in to that account via the &#x60;/authorization/device&#x60; endpoint, without needing to provide the  credentials of the user. 

### Example

```javascript
import RocketServices from 'rocket_services';

let apiInstance = new RocketServices.AuthorizationApi();
let deviceRegistrationRequest = new RocketServices.DeviceRegistrationRequest(); // DeviceRegistrationRequest | Details of the device being authorized.
let opts = {
  'ff': ["null"], // [String] | The set of opt in feature flags which cause breaking changes to responses.  While Rocket APIs look to avoid breaking changes under the active major version, the formats of responses may need to evolve over this time.  These feature flags allow clients to select which response formats they expect and avoid breaking clients as these formats evolve under the current major version.  ### Flags  - `all` - Enable all flags. Useful for testing. _Don't use in production_. - `idp` - Dynamic item detail pages with schedulable rows. - `ldp` - Dynamic list detail pages with schedulable rows. - `hb` - Hubble formatted image urls. - `rpt` - Updated resume point threshold logic. - `cas` - \"Custom Asset Search\", inlcude `customAssets` in search results. - `lrl` - Do not pre-populate related list if more than `max_list_prefetch` down the page. - `cd` - Custom Destination support.  See the `feature-flags.md` for available flag details. 
  'lang': "lang_example" // String | Language code for the preferred language to be returned in the response.  Parameter value is case-insensitive and should be   - a valid 2 letter language code without region such as en, de   - or with region such as en_us, en_au  If undefined then defaults to 'en', unless the server has been configured with a custom default.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes 
};
apiInstance.generateDeviceAuthorizationCode(deviceRegistrationRequest, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
});

## getAccountToken

> [AccessToken] getAccountToken(accountTokenRequest, opts)



Request one or more &#x60;Account&#x60; level authorization tokens each with a chosen scope.  Tokens are used to access restricted service endpoints. These restricted endpoints will require a specific token type (e.g Account) with a specific scope (e.g. Catalog) before access is granted.  For convenience, where a Profile level token with the same scope exists it will also be returned.  Authorization with pin is not supported on this endpoint anymore. Use &#x60;/itv/pinauthorization&#x60; endpoint instead. 

### Example

```javascript
import RocketServices from 'rocket_services';

let apiInstance = new RocketServices.AuthorizationApi();
let accountTokenRequest = new RocketServices.AccountTokenRequest(); // AccountTokenRequest | The account credentials with requested token scope.
let opts = {
  'ff': ["null"], // [String] | The set of opt in feature flags which cause breaking changes to responses.  While Rocket APIs look to avoid breaking changes under the active major version, the formats of responses may need to evolve over this time.

## getAccountTokenByCode

> [AccessToken] getAccountTokenByCode(accountTokenByCodeRequest, opts)



Get Catalog tokens for an account using a device authorization code. Where a Profile level token of Catalog scope exists it will also be returned.  This is the final step in the process of authorizing a device by pin code.  Firstly the device must request a generated authorization code via the &#x60;/authorization/device/code&#x60; endpoint.  The code is subsequently used to authorize the device to sign in to a given account via the &#x60;/account/devices/authorization&#x60; endpoint. Typically this will be from a page presented in the web app under the account section.  Once authorized, this endpoint will allow the device to sign in without needing to provide the credentials of the user. 

### Example

```javascript
import RocketServices from 'rocket_services';

let apiInstance = new RocketServices.AuthorizationApi();
let accountTokenByCodeRequest = new RocketServices.AccountTokenByCodeRequest(); // AccountTokenByCodeRequest | The device id e.g. serial number and authorization code.
