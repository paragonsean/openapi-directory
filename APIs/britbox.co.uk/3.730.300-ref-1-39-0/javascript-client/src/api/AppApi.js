/**
 * Rocket Services
 * An Orchestration Layer that takes ISL services and packages them in a more targeted way for front-end applications. This in turn makes client integration easier and reduces the complexity and size of front-end applications.  Rocket is also customisable - allowing UI engineers to ‘remix’ the existing back-end services into something that best suits the application they are developing.

For example if your browser path looks like `/search?q=the` then what you pass to this endpoint would look like `/itv/page?path=/search%3Fq%3Dthe`. 
     * @param {String} path The path of the page to load, e.g. '/movies'.
     * @param {Object} opts Optional parameters
     * @param {Number} [listPageSize = 12)] The number of items to load when prefetching and paging each list in the page row.
     * @param {Number} [listPageSizeLarge = 50)] The number of items to load when prefetching a continuous scroll list entry in a page.  By default any list page entry with template pattern `/^CS\\d+$/` will be considered a continuous scroll list. 
     * @param {Number} [maxListPrefetch = 2)] The maximum number of lists to prefetch in the page.
     * @param {module:model/String} [itemDetailExpand] Only relevant when loading item detail pages as these embed a detailed item in the main page entry.  If no value is specified no item dependencies are expanded.  If 'children' is specified then the list of any direct children will be expanded. For example seasons of a show or episodes of a season.  If 'all' is specified then the parent chain will be expanded along with any child list at each level. For example if an episode is specified then its season will be expanded and that season's episode list. The season will have its show expanded and the show will have its season list expanded.  The 'all' options is useful when you deep link into a show/season/episode for the first time as it provides full context for navigating around the show page. Subsequent navigation around children of the show should only need to request expand of children.  If 'ancestors' is specified then only the parent chain is included  If an expand is specified which is not relevant to the item type, it will be ignored. 
     * @param {module:model/String} [itemDetailSelectSeason] Only relevant when loading show detail pages as these embed a detailed item in the main page entry.  Since the introduction of the D1,2,3 templates this parameter is now somewhat redundant, or less likely to have any effect. While it may still be useful in some cases, most of the time the season selection will be dictated by the configuration of the rows scheduled on the show detail page. This parameter will only take effect if there are rows used to schedule episodes of a season, like D1,2,3, or if no rows have a value set for their `seasonOrder` custom field.  Given a targeted show page, it can be useful to get the details of a child season. This option provides a means to return the `first` or `latest` season of a show embedded in the page.  The `expand` parameter also works here so for example you could land on a show page and request the `item_detail_select_season=latest` along with `item_detail_expand=all`. This would then return the detail of the latest season with its list of child episode summaries, and also expand the detail of the show with its list of seasons summaries. 
     * @param {module:model/String} [textEntryFormat = 'markdown')] Only relevant to page entries of type `TextEntry`.  Converts the value of a text page entry to the specified format. 
     * @param {String} [maxRating] The maximum rating (inclusive) of items returned, e.g. 'auoflc-pg'.
     * @param {String} [device = 'web_browser')] The type of device the content is targeting.
     * @param {String} [sub] The active subscription code.
