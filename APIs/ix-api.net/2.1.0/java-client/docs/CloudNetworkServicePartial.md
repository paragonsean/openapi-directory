|**chargedUntil** | **LocalDate** | Your obligation to pay for the service will end on this date. Typically &#x60;â‰¥ decommission_at&#x60;.  This field is only used when the state is &#x60;DECOMMISSION_REQUESTED&#x60; or &#x60;DECOMMISSIONED&#x60;. |  [optional] |
|**cloudKey** | **String** |  |  [optional] |
