    An `Account` represents an individual customer account, organization
    or partner involved with the IXP. They are used to consume
    services from an IXP.

    Accounts can have a hierarchy, i.e. an
    account can have sub-accounts. The max-depth of
    the account-hierarchy may vary by implementer, but it's safe to
    assume an account can have sub-accounts.

    Each `Account` has a state. Only `Account`s in state `production`
    or `production_state_pending` are ready to consume services.

    There are `Contact`s associated with each account. Contacts can
    be assigned for `Role`s via `RoleAssignment`s. Depending on the
    IXP and the services the account wants to use, contacts with
    specific roles may be required.
    A contact with role `legal` is mandatory for an account to become
    operational.

    Only accounts with `billing_information` present can be used
    as a `billing_account`.

    Open an authorized session with the IX-API. This is equivalent to
    a 'login' endpoint.

    Upon success, you will receive an `access_token` and
    a `refreh_token`. Both are JWTs and have limited lifetimes. You
    can get information like their expiry time directly by parsing
    the tokens.

    Use the `access_token` as `Bearer` in your `Authorization` header
    for getting access to the API.

    When the session (i.e. the `access_token`) expires, use the
    `refresh_token` (if it's not yet expired) with the
    `refresh`-endpoint to reauthenticate and get a fresh `access_token`.

    A `Connection` is a functional group of physical connections
    collected together into a LAG (aka trunk).

    A `connection` with only one `port` can be also configured as
    standalone which means no LAG configuration on the switch.
  name: connections
- description: |-
    A `Contact` is a role undertaking a specific responsibility
    within an account, typically a department or agent of the
    customer company.

    `Contact`s are assigned multiple roles by `RoleAssignment`s.

    A contact is bound to the account by the `consuming_account` property.

    This endpoint provides a health status response implementing

    supported types and operations here.

    An `IP` is a IPv4 or 6 addresses, with a given validity period.
    Some services require IP addresses to work.

    When you are joining an `exchange_lan` network service
    for example, addresses on the peering lan will be assigned
    to you.
  name: ips

    A `MAC` is a MAC addresses with a given validity period.

    Some services require MAC addresses to work.
    Please note that only *unicast* MAC addresses are allowed.
    You are not alllowed to use multicast or broadcast addresses.

    The address itself can not be updated after creation.
    However: It can be expired by changing the `valid_not_before`
    and `valid_not_after` properties.
  name: macs
- description: |-
    A `MemberJoiningRule` defines a rule to allow or deny access for
    an `Account` to a access a `NetworkService`.

    Furthermore, some `NetworkService`s may only be visible if the
    querying account is listed in an allow rule.
  name: member-joining-rules

    Services are provided directly on or can be consumed
    from inside a `MetroAreaNetwork`.

    Accounts can indicate their presence in a `MetroAreaNetwork`
    to others by adding a list of ids.

    A `NetworkFeatureConfig` is a configuration for
    using a `NetworkFeature`.

    For certain `NetworkFeature`s, which are marked as required,
    one `NetworkFeatureConfig needs to be created in order to move
    the `NetworkServiceConfig` into `production`.
  name: network-feature-configs

    A `NetworkFeature` represents additional funcationality of a single
    `NetworkService`.

    For certain `NetworkFeature`s, which are marked as required,
    one `NetworkFeatureConfig needs to be created in order to move
    the  `NetworkServiceConfig` into `production`.
  name: network-features
- description: |-
    A `NetworkServiceConfig` is a customer's configuration for usage
    of a `NetworkService`, e.g. the configuration of a (subset of a)
    connection for that customer's traffic

    The `type` of the config determines the service you are
    configuring.

    You can find the services available to you on the platform,
    by querying the `NetworkService`s resource.

    For certain `NetworkFeature`s, which are marked as required,
    one `NetworkFeatureConfig needs to be created in order to move
    the  `NetworkServiceConfig` into `production`.

    A `NetworkService` represents an instance of a `ProductOffering`.

    The exchange lan is a special case in which the `NetworkService` is
    managed by the exchange.

    All other `NetworkService`s are created and managed by an `Account`.
  name: network-services

    A `PointOfPresence` is a technical installation within a Facility
    which is connected to a single `MetroAreaNetwork`. A single
    `MetroAreaNetwork`, however, may have multiple `PointOfPresence`s.

    A `Port` is the point at which subscriber and
    IXP networks meet. A port is always associated with
    a `device` and `pop`, has a `speed` and a `media_type`.

    A `Role` enables a `Contact` to act for a specific purpose.

        Update parts of an ip address.


        As with the `PUT` opertaion, IP addresses, where you
        don't have update rights, will yield a `resource access denied`
        error when attempting an update.

        If the ip address was allocated for you, you might
        not be able to change anything but the `fqdn`.

        Request decomissioning of the network service.

        The network service will enter the state of
        `decommission_requested`. The request will
        cascade to related network service and feature
        configs.

        An *optional request body* can be provided to request
        a specific service termination date.

        If no date is given in the request body, it is assumed to
        be the earliest possible date.

        Possible values for `decommission_at` can be queried
        through the `network_service_cancellation_policy_read`
        operation.

        The response will contain the dates on which the
        changes will be effected.

        Request a change to the network service.

        A participant in a network service of type
        `p2p_vc` can issue a change request, expressing a
        desired change in the capacity.
        The change is accepted when all sides have configured
        the network service configs with the new bandwidth.
        These changes can sometimes require a change of the
        product offering.
        The product offering may only differ in regards to
        bandwidth.

        The network service will change it's state from `production`
        into `production_change_pending`.

        Only one change request may be issued at a time.

            The "checks" object MAY have a number of unique keys,
            one for each logical downstream dependency or sub-component.

            Since each sub-component may be backed by several nodes
            with varying health statuses, these keys point to arrays
            of objects. In case of a single-node sub-component
            (or if presence of nodes is not relevant), a single-element
            array SHOULD be used as the value, for consistency.

            are allowed inbound to the route server. All other routes are
            filtered.
