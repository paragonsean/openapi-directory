Vault API

- API version: 10.0.0
- Generator version: 7.9.0

Welcome to the Vault API 👋

When you're looking to connect to an API, the first step is authentication.

Vault helps you handle OAuth flows, store API keys, and refresh access tokens from users (called consumers in Apideck).

## Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`

## Get Started

To use the Apideck APIs, you need to sign up for free at [https://app.apideck.com/signup](). Follow the steps below to get started.

- [Create a free account.](https://app.apideck.com/signup)
- Go to the [Dashboard](https://app.apideck.com/unify/unified-apis/dashboard).
- Get your API key and the application ID.
- Select and configure the integrations you want to make available to your users. Through the Unify dashboard, you can configure which connectors you want to support as integrations.
- Retrieve the client_id and client_secret for the integration you want to activate (Only needed for OAuth integrations).
- Soon, you can skip the previous step and use the Apideck sandbox credentials to get you started instead (upcoming)
- Register the redirect URI for the example app (https://unify.apideck.com/vault/callback) in the list of redirect URIs under your app's settings
- Use the [publishing guides](/app-listing-requirements) to get your integration listed across app marketplaces.

### Hosted Vault

Hosted Vault (vault.apideck.com) is a no-code solution, so you don't need to build your own UI to handle the integration settings and authentication.

![Hosted Vault - Integrations portal](https://github.com/apideck-samples/integration-settings/raw/master/public/img/vault.png)

Behind the scenes, Hosted Vault implements the Vault API endpoints and handles the following features for your customers:

- Add a connection
- Handle the OAuth flow
- Configure connection settings per integration
- Manage connections
- Discover and propose integration options
- Search for integrations (upcoming)
- Give integration suggestions based on provided metadata (email or website) when creating the session (upcoming)

To use Hosted Vault, you will need to first [**create a session**](https://developers.apideck.com/apis/vault/reference#operation/sessionsCreate). This can be achieved by making a POST request to the Vault API to create a valid session for a user, hereafter referred to as the consumer ID.

Example using curl:

```
curl -X POST https://unify.apideck.com/vault/sessions
    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"
    -H \"Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>\"
    -H \"X-APIDECK-CONSUMER-ID: <consumer-id>\"
    -H \"X-APIDECK-APP-ID: <application-id>\"
    -d '{\"consumer_metadata\": { \"account_name\" : \"Sample\", \"user_name\": \"Sand Box\", \"email\": \"sand@box.com\", \"image\": \"https://unavatar.now.sh/jake\" }, \"theme\": { \"vault_name\": \"Intercom\", \"primary_color\": \"#286efa\", \"sidepanel_background_color\": \"#286efa\",\"sidepanel_text_color\": \"#FFFFFF\", \"favicon\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/apideck/icons/intercom\" }}'
```

### Vault API

_Beware, this is strategy takes more time to implement in comparison to Hosted Vault._

If you are building your integration settings UI manually, you can call the Vault API directly.

The Vault API is for those who want to completely white label the in-app integrations overview and authentication experience. All the available endpoints are listed below.

Through the API, your customers authenticate directly in your app, where Vault will still take care of redirecting to the auth provider and back to your app.

If you're already storing access tokens, we will help you migrate through our Vault Migration API (upcoming).

## Domain model

At its core, a domain model creates a web of interconnected entities.

Our domain model contains five main entity types: Consumer (user, account, team, machine), Application, Connector, Integration, and Connection.

## Connection state

The connection state is computed based on the connection flow below.

![](https://developers.apideck.com/api-references/vault/connection-flow.png)

More information about the connection state can be found in the [Connection state](https://developers.apideck.com/guides/connection-states) guide.

## Unify and Proxy integration

The only thing you need to use the Unify APIs and Proxy is the consumer id; thereafter, Vault will do the look-up in the background to handle the token injection before performing the API call(s).

## Headers

Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.

| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description |
| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/api-keys. |
| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |
| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes. |

## FAQ

**What purpose does Vault serve? Can I just handle the authentication and access token myself?**
You can store everything yourself, but that defeats the purpose of using Apideck Unify. Handling tokens for multiple providers can quickly become very complex.

### Is my data secure?

Vault employs data minimization, therefore only requesting the minimum amount of scopes needed to perform an API request.

### How do I migrate existing data?

Using our migration API, you can migrate the access tokens and accounts to Apideck Vault.

### Can I use Vault in combination with existing integrations?

Yes, you can. The flexibility of Unify allows you to quickly the use cases you need while keeping a gradual migration path based on your timeline and requirements.

### How does Vault work for Apideck Ecosystem customers?

Once logged in, pick your ecosystem; on the left-hand side of the screen, you'll have the option to create an application underneath the Unify section.

### How to integrate Apideck Vault

This section covers everything you need to know to authenticate your customers through Vault.
Vault provides **three auth strategies** to use API tokens from your customers:

- Vault API
- Hosted Vault
- Vault Widget (JS, React, Vue)

You can also opt to bypass Vault and still take care of authentication flows yourself. Make sure to put the right safeguards in place to protect your customers' tokens and other sensitive data.

### What auth types does Vault support?

We support all the common authentication types, including: API keys, OAuth, Basic auth, and more.

#### API keys

For Services supporting the API key strategy, you can use Hosted Vault will need to provide an in-app form where users can configure their API keys provided by the integration service.

#### OAuth 2.0

##### Authorization Code Grant Type Flow

Vault handles the complete Authorization Code Grant Type Flow for you. This flow only supports browser-based (passive) authentication because most identity providers don't allow entering a username and password to be entered into applications that they don't own.

Certain connectors require an OAuth redirect authentication flow, where the end-user is redirected to the provider's website or mobile app to authenticate.

This is being handled by the `/authorize` endpoint.

#### Basic auth

Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The required fields to complete basic auth are handled by Hosted Vault or by updating the connection through the Vault API below.

## Documentation for Servers

Parameterized Servers are supported. Define a server in the API for each endpoint with arbitrary numbers of variables:

```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:{port}/{basePath}
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
    port:
      enum:
        - '3000'
        - '1000'
      default: '3000'
    basePath:
      default: v1
```
To change the default variable, use this function in each Api:
```c++
int setDefaultServerValue(int serverIndex,const QString &operation, const QString &variable,const QString &val);
```
The parameter "serverIndex" will choose a server from the server list for each endpoint. There is always at least one server with index 0. The Parameter "operation" should be the desired endpoint operationid.
Variable is the name of the variable you wish to change and the value is the new default Value.
The function will return -1 when the variable does not exists, -2 if value is not defined in the variable enum and -3 if the operation is not found.

If your endpoint has multiple server objects in the servers array, you can set the server that will be used with this function:
```c++
void setServerIndex(const QString &operation, int serverIndex);
```
Parameter "operation" should be your operationid. "serverIndex" is the index you want to set as your default server. The function will check if there is a server with your index.
Here is an example of multiple servers in the servers array. The first server will have index 0 and the second will have index 1.
```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:8080/
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
- url: https://localhost:8080/v1
```
