    # Summary
    The **Swiss NextGen API** is based on the NextGenPSD2 *Framework Version 1.3.4* of the Berlin Group which offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of
    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to provide data securely.
    The NextGen Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses the problem of multiple competing standards
    in Europe and, aligned with the goals of the Euro Retail Payments Board,
    enables European banking customers to benefit from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service')
    by granting TPPs safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their bank accounts and financial data.

    The Swiss edtion refines the message formats specific to Switzerland and defines some matching examples.

    The possible Approaches are:
      * Redirect SCA Approach
      * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) OAuth SCA Approach*
      * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Decoupled SCA Approach*
      * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Embedded SCA Approach without SCA method*
      * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available*
      * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Embedded SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method*

      Not every message defined in this API definition is necessary for all approaches.
      Furthermore this API definition does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional
      Therefore for a particular implementation of a compliant API it is only necessary to support
      a certain subset of the methods defined in this API definition.

      **Please have a look at the implementation guidelines if you are not sure
      which message has to be used for the approach you are going to use.**

    ## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification:
    * **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the [Berlin Group API](https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads).**
      It is not a replacement in any sense.
      The main specification is (at the moment) always the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group API.
    * **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to the ASPSP.**
    * **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches defined in the Implementation Guidelines.**
    * According to the OpenAPI-Specification [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]

        "If in is "header" and the name field is "Accept", "Content-Type" or "Authorization", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored."

      The element "Accept" will not be defined in this file at any place.

      The elements "Content-Type" and "Authorization" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags "content" and "security".

    * There are several predefined types which might occur in payment initiation messages,
      but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation Guidelines.
      Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this file either.
      We added them for the convenience of the user.
      If there is a payment product, which needs these fields, one can easily use the predefined types.
      But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.

    * **We omit the definition of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional)
      except they are mentioned in the Implementation Guidelines.**
      Therefore the implementer might add these in his own realisation of a comlient API in addition to the elements defined in this file.

    ## General Remarks on Data Types

    The Berlin Group definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the API have to support at least the following characters

    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Please note that in case of example-TPP.com as certificate entry TPP- Notification-URI like www.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications or notifications.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications would be compliant.

          Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the ASPSP.
           ASPSPs may respond with ASPSP-Notification-Support set to false, if the provided URIs do not comply.

          repeated.
          The usage of the constants supports the of following semantics:

            SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.

            PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.
            LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP.

          This header field may be ignored, if the ASPSP does not support resource notification services for the related TPP.

          The usage of the constants supports the of following semantics:

            SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.

            PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.

          This header field may by ignored by the ASPSP.

          For security reasons, it shall be ensured that the TPP-Notification-URI as introduced above is secured by the TPP eIDAS QWAC used for identification of the TPP. The following applies:

          URIs which are provided by TPPs in TPP-Notification-URI shall comply with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate. Please note that in case of example-TPP.com as certificate entry TPP- Notification-URI like www.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications or notifications.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications would be compliant.

          Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the ASPSP.
           ASPSPs may respond with ASPSP-Notification-Support set to false, if the provided URIs do not comply.

            SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.

            PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.

          This header field may be ignored, if the ASPSP does not support resource notification services for the related TPP.

        \ Variants of payment initiation requests\n\nThis method to initiate a payment\
        \ initiation at the ASPSP can be sent with either a JSON body or an pain.001\
        \ body depending on the payment product in the path.\n\nThere are the following\
        \ **payment products**:\n\n  - Payment products with payment information in\
        \ *JSON* format:\n    - ***domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-isr***\n    - ***domestic-swiss-credit-transfers***\n\
        \    - ***domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-qr***\n    - ***domestic-swiss-foreign-credit-transfers***\n\
        \    - ***swiss-sepa-credit-transfers***\n    - ***swiss-cross-border-credit-transfers***\n\
        \  - Payment products with payment information in *SIX pain.001* XML format:\n\
        \    - ***pain.001-sepa-credit-transfers***\n    - ***pain.001-cross-border-credit-transfers***\n\
        \    - ***pain.001-swiss-six-credit-transfers***\n\nFurthermore the request\
        \ body depends on the **payment-service**:\n  * ***payments***: A single payment\
        \ initiation request.\n  * ***bulk-payments***: A collection of several payment\
        \ initiation requests.\n  \n    In case of a *pain.001* message there are\
        \ more than one payments contained in the *pain.001 message.\n\n    In case\
        \ of a *JSON* there are several JSON payment blocks contained in a joining\
        \ list.\n  * ***periodic-payments***:\n    Create a standing order initiation\
        \ resource for recurrent i.e. periodic payments addressable under {paymentId}\n\
        \     with all data relevant for the corresponding payment product and the\
        \ execution of the standing order contained in a JSON body.\n\nThis is the\
        \ first step in the API to initiate the related recurring/periodic payment.\n\
        \n## Single and mulitilevel SCA Processes\n\nThe payment initiation requests\
        \ are independent from the need of one or multilevel \nSCA processing, i.e.\
        \ independent from the number of authorisations needed for the execution of\
        \ payments. \n\nBut the response messages are specific to either one SCA processing\
        \ or multilevel SCA processing. \n\nFor payment initiation with multilevel\
        \ SCA, this specification requires an explicit start of the authorisation,\
        \ \ni.e. links directly associated with SCA processing like 'scaRedirect'\
        \ or 'scaOAuth' cannot be contained in the \nresponse message of a Payment\
        \ Initation Request for a payment, where multiple authorisations are needed.\
        \ \nAlso if any data is needed for the next action, like selecting an SCA\
        \ method is not supported in the response, \nsince all starts of the multiple\
        \ authorisations are fully equal. \nIn these cases, first an authorisation\
        \ sub-resource has to be generated following the 'startAuthorisation' link.\n"

          **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.

          the XML pain.001 schemes provided by EPC are supported by the ASPSP as a minimum for the body content.

          **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.

          This preference might be ignored by the ASPSP, if a signing basket is not supported as functionality.

          If it equals "false" or if the parameter is not used, there is no preference of the TPP.
          This especially indicates that the TPP assumes a direct authorisation of the transaction in the next step,
          without using a signing basket.

            - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers
            - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-qr

          **Remark:** For all SEPA Credit Transfer based endpoints which accept XML encoding,
          the XML pain.001 schemes provided by EPC are supported by the ASPSP as a minimum for the body content.
          Further XML schemes might be supported by some communities.

          **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.
          There are plenty of country specificic scheme variants.

          **Remark:** For all SEPA Credit Transfer based endpoints which accept XML encoding,
          the XML pain.001 schemes provided by EPC are supported by the ASPSP as a minimum for the body content.
          Further XML schemes might be supported by some communities.

          **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.
          There are plenty of country specificic scheme variants.

          The following payment products are supported:
            - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-isr
            - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers
            - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-qr

          **Remark:** For all SEPA Credit Transfer based endpoints which accept XML encoding,
          the XML pain.001 schemes provided by EPC are supported by the ASPSP as a minimum for the body content.
          Further XML schemes might be supported by some communities.

          **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.
          There are plenty of country specificic scheme variants.

          The following payment products are supported:
            - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-isr
            - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers
            - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-qr

          **Remark:** For all SEPA Credit Transfer based endpoints which accept XML encoding,
          the XML pain.001 schemes provided by EPC are supported by the ASPSP as a minimum for the body content.
          Further XML schemes might be supported by some communities.

          **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.
          There are plenty of country specificic scheme variants.

          The addressed payment product endpoint, e.g. for SEPA Credit Transfers (SCT).
          The ASPSP will publish which of the payment products/endpoints will be supported.

          The following payment products are supported:
            - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-isr
            - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers
            - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-qr

            - pain.001-cross-border-credit-transfers
            - pain.001-swiss-six-credit-transfers

          **Remark:** For all SEPA Credit Transfer based endpoints which accept XML encoding,
          the XML pain.001 schemes provided by EPC are supported by the ASPSP as a minimum for the body content.
          Further XML schemes might be supported by some communities.

          **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.
          There are plenty of country specificic scheme variants.

          URIs which are provided by TPPs in TPP-Notification-URI shall comply with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate. Please note that in case of example-TPP.com as certificate entry TPP- Notification-URI like www.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications or notifications.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications would be compliant.

          Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the ASPSP.
           ASPSPs may respond with ASPSP-Notification-Support set to false, if the provided URIs do not comply.

          **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.

          **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.
          There are plenty of country specificic scheme variants.

        Further XML schemes might be supported by some communities.

        **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.
        There are plenty of country specificic scheme variants.

        Generic body for a bulk payment initation entry.

        The bulk entry type is a type which follows the JSON formats for the supported products for single payments
        excluding the data elements (if supported):
          * debtorAccount
          * requestedExecutionDate,
          * requestedExecutionTime.
        These data elements may not be contained in any bulk entry.

        This data object can be used to represent valid bulk payment initiations entry for the following JSON based payment product,
        which where defined in the Implementation Guidelines:

          * domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-isr
          * domestic-swiss-credit-transfers
          * domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-qr
          * domestic-swiss-foreign-credit-transfers
          * swiss-sepa-credit-transfers
          * swiss-cross-border-credit-transfers

        For the convenience of the implementer additional which are already predefinded in the Implementation Guidelines
        are included (but commented in source code), such that an ASPSP may add them easily.

        Take care: Since the format is intended to fit for all payment products
        there are additional conditions which are NOT covered by this specification.
        Please check the SIX Swiss Payment Standards implementation guidelines for details.

        Generic Body for a periodic payment initation via JSON.

        This generic JSON body can be used to represent valid periodic payment initiations for the following JSON based payment product,
        which where defined in the Implementation Guidelines:

          * domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-isr
          * domestic-swiss-credit-transfers
          * domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-qr
          * domestic-swiss-foreign-credit-transfers
          * swiss-sepa-credit-transfers
          * swiss-cross-border-credit-transfers

        For the convenience of the implementer additional which are already predefinded in the Implementation Guidelines
        are included (but commented in source code), such that an ASPSP may add them easily.

            This data element might be contained, if SCA is required and if the PSU has a choice between different
            authentication methods.

            Depending on the risk management of the ASPSP this choice might be offered before or after the PSU
            has been identified with the first relevant factor, or if an access token is transported.

            If this data element is contained, then there is also a hyperlink of type 'startAuthorisationWithAuthenticationMethodSelection'
            contained in the response body.

            These methods shall be presented towards the PSU for selection by the TPP.

          Settlement on the creditor's account has been completed.
        - 'ACCP': 'AcceptedCustomerProfile' -
          Preceding check of technical validation was successful.
          Customer profile check was also successful.
        - 'ACSC': 'AcceptedSettlementCompleted' -
          Settlement on the debtoro?=s account has been completed.

          **Usage:** this can be used by the first agent to report to the debtor that the transaction has been completed.

          **Warning:** this status is provided for transaction status reasons, not for financial information.
          It can only be used after bilateral agreement.
        - 'ACSP': 'AcceptedSettlementInProcess' -
          All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution.
        - 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' -
          Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful.
        - 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' -
          Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent.
        - 'ACWP': 'AcceptedWithoutPosting' -
          Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted without being posted to the creditor customero?=s account.
        - 'RCVD': 'Received' -
          Payment initiation has been received by the receiving agent.
        - 'PDNG': 'Pending' -
          Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation is pending.
          Further checks and status update will be performed.
        - 'RJCT': 'Rejected' -
          Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected.
        - 'CANC': 'Cancelled'
          Payment initiation has been cancelled before execution
          Remark: This codeis accepted as new code by ISO20022.
        - 'ACFC': 'AcceptedFundsChecked' -
          Preceding check of technical validation and customer profile was successful and an automatic funds check was positive .
          Remark: This code is accepted as new code by ISO20022.
        - 'PATC': 'PartiallyAcceptedTechnical'
          Correct The payment initiation needs multiple authentications, where some but not yet all have been performed. Syntactical and semantical validations are successful.
          Remark: This code is accepted as new code by ISO20022.
        - 'PART': 'PartiallyAccepted' -
          A number of transactions have been accepted, whereas another number of transactions have not yet achieved 'accepted' status.
          Remark: This code may be used only in case of bulk payments. It is only used in a situation where all mandated authorisations have been applied, but some payments have been rejected.
