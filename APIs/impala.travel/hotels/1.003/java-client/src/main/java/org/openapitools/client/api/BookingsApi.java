     * @param start Allows for filtering based on arrival date of the booking in ISO 8601 format (e.g. &#x60;2021-12-01&#x60;). Available modifiers include less than (&#x60;lt&#x60;), greater than (&#x60;gt&#x60;), lower than or equal to (&#x60;lte&#x60;), greater than or equal to (&#x60;gte&#x60;) and equal to (&#x60;eq&#x60;).

     * @param end Allows for filtering based on departure date of the booking in ISO 8601 format (e.g. &#x60;2021-12-01&#x60;).

     * Change a booking contact (asynchronously)
     * Updates a confirmed booking with the booking contact details you provide in the request body.  In addition, we require you to supply a &#x60;updateBookingVersionAtTimestamp&#x60; field with the &#x60;updatedAt&#x60; timestamp of the booking. You can find this value by looking up the booking via the [Retrieve a booking](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1bookings~1%7BbookingId%7D/get) endpoint. This is to avoid race conditions where another update might have happened since the last time you have checked for the current details of this booking.
     * @param bookingId The unique identifier of the booking you would like to update. (required)
     * @param updateBookingContactRequest  (optional)
     * @param _callback The callback to be executed when the API call finishes
     * @return The request call
     * @throws ApiException If fail to process the API call, e.g. serializing the request body object
     * @http.response.details
