Examples of rate plans:  * Non-refundable room rate that includes breakfast * Room-only rate with free cancellation up to 14 days before arrival  For each such rate plan this endpoint returns the room types it&#39;s available for, alongside prices for each date and occupancy that can be sold â€“ or the information that the room isn&#39;t available (closed) for a certain date.  For the vast majority of our customers, availability searches using the [List all hotels](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1hotels/get) endpoint are the best choice. It accepts the dates your guest is looking for and provides the rates to display.  This endpoint can help augment this for two additional use cases:  This endpoint allows you to query rate prices for all future dates in one go, making it a great choice to feed availability information and prices into your own system or displaying a rate calender to guide your guests to gain an overview of future availability and prices.
