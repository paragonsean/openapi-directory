If the booking you cancelled allows for a partial or full refund, we&#39;ll credit your Impala balance with the amount we charged you as the seller of this booking – meaning we&#39;ll deduct the amount the next time we&#39;re requesting payment for the sum of all the bookings you made.

We&#39;ll use the business credit card you&#39;ve added to your account as payment method for this. * The difference between the amount you charge your guest (&#x60;retailRate&#x60;, e.g. 200 €) and what Impala charges you (&#x60;retailRate&#x60; minus &#x60;sellerCommissionPercentage&#x60;, e.g. 200 €) is your commission (in this example: 20 €) to keep.  You can find more information on how money flows between your guest and you, and you and Impala, [in this article](https://impala.stoplight.io/docs/booking-api/branches/v1.003/docs/good-to-know/payments-and-commissions.md)  &lt;!-- theme: warning --&gt;  &gt; **This request might take up to 20 seconds to load.** While we work to return a response to your request within milliseconds in most cases, some bookings require us to re-verify current pricing in real-time and doing so might take up to 20 seconds.

You can filter the list based on when bookings were created or last updated, as well as their arrival (&#x60;start&#x60;) and departure (&#x60;end&#x60;).

Any new rates selected must be for the same hotel as the original booking.  A booking cannot be updated on or after the check in day of the original or new stay.  In addition, we require you do supply a &#x60;updateBookingVersionAtTimestamp&#x60; field with the &#x60;updatedAt&#x60; timestamp of the booking.
