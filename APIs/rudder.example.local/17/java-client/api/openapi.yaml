    # Introduction

    Rudder exposes a REST API, enabling the user to interact with Rudder without using the webapp, for example in scripts or cronjobs.

    ## Versioning

    Each time the API is extended with new features (new functions, new parameters, new responses, ...), it will be assigned a new version number. This will allow you
    to keep your existing scripts (based on previous behavior). Versions will always be integers (no 2.1 or 3.3, just 2, 3, 4, ...) or `latest`.

    You can change the version of the API used by setting it either within the url or in a header:

    * the URL: each URL is prefixed by its version id, like `/api/version/function`.

    ```bash
    # Version 10
    curl -X GET -H "X-API-Token: yourToken" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/10/rules
    # Latest
    curl -X GET -H "X-API-Token: yourToken" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/latest/rules
    # Wrong (not an integer) => 404 not found
    curl -X GET -H "X-API-Token: yourToken" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/3.14/rules
    ```

    * the HTTP headers. You can add the **X-API-Version** header to your request. The value needs to be an integer or `latest`.

    ```bash
    # Version 10
    curl -X GET -H "X-API-Token: yourToken" -H "X-API-Version: 10" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules
    # Wrong => Error response indicating which versions are available
    curl -X GET -H "X-API-Token: yourToken" -H "X-API-Version: 3.14" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules
    ```

    In the future, we may declare some versions as deprecated, in order to remove them in a later version of Rudder, but we will never remove any versions without warning, or without a safe
    period of time to allow migration from previous versions.

    </table>


    ## Response format

    All responses from the API are in the JSON format.

    ```json
    {
      "action": "The name of the called function",
      "id": "The ID of the element you want, if relevant",
      "result": "The result of your action: success or error",
      "data": "Only present if this is a success and depends on the function, it's usually a JSON object",
      "errorDetails": "Only present if this is an error, it contains the error message"
    }
    ```


    * __Success__ responses are sent with the 200 HTTP (Success) code

    * __Error__ responses are sent with a HTTP error code (mostly 5xx...)


    ## HTTP method

    Rudder's REST API is based on the usage of [HTTP methods](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html). We use them to indicate what action will be done by the request. Currently, we use four of them:


    * **GET**: search or retrieve information (get rule details, get a group, ...)

    * **PUT**: add new objects (create a directive, clone a Rule, ...)

    * **DELETE**: remove objects (delete a node, delete a parameter, ...)

    * **POST**: update existing objects (update a directive, reload a group, ...)


    ## Parameters

    ### General parameters

    Some parameters are available for almost all API functions. They will be described in this section.
    They must be part of the query and can't be submitted in a JSON form.

    #### Available for all requests

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 30%">Field</th>
          <th style="width: 10%">Type</th>
          <th style="width: 70%">Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="code">prettify</td>
          <td><b>boolean</b><br><i>optional</i></td>
          <td>
            Determine if the answer should be prettified (human friendly) or not. We recommend using this for debugging purposes, but not for general script usage as this does add some unnecessary load on the server side.
            <p class="default-value">Default value: <code>false</code></p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>


    #### Available for modification requests (PUT/POST/DELETE)

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 25%">Field</th>
          <th style="width: 12%">Type</th>

        <tr>
          <td class="code">reason</td>
          <td><b>string</b><br><i>optional</i> or <i>required</i></td>
          <td>
            Set a message to explain the change. If you set the reason messages to be mandatory in the web interface, failing to supply this value will lead to an error.
            <p class="default-value">Default value: <code>""</code></p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="code">changeRequestName</td>
          <td><b>string</b><br><i>optional</i></td>
          <td>
            Set the change request name, is used only if workflows are enabled. The default value depends on the function called
            <p class="default-value">Default value: <code>A default string for each function</code></p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="code">changeRequestDescription</td>
          <td><b>string</b><br><i>optional</i></td>
          <td>
            Set the change request description, is used only if workflows are enabled.
            <p class="default-value">Default value: <code>""</code></p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>


    ### Passing parameters

    Parameters to the API can be sent:

    * As part of the URL for resource identification

    * As data for POST/PUT requests

      * Directly in JSON format

      * As request arguments

    #### As part of the URL for resource identification

    Parameters in URLs are used to indicate which resource you want to interact with. The function will not work if this resource is missing.

    ```bash
    # Get the Rule of ID "id"
    curl -H "X-API-Token: yourToken" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/latest/rules/id
    ```



    CAUTION: To avoid surprising behavior, do not put a '/' at the end of an URL: it would be interpreted as '/[empty string parameter]' and redirected to '/index', likely not what you wanted to do.


    #### Sending data for POST/PUT requests

    ##### Directly in JSON format

    JSON format is the preferred way to interact with Rudder API for creating or updating resources.
    You'll also have to set the *Content-Type* header to **application/json** (without it the JSON content would be ignored).
    In a `curl` `POST` request, that header can be provided with the `-H` parameter:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" ...
    ```

    The supplied file must contain a valid JSON: strings need quotes, booleans and integers don't, etc.

    The (human readable) format is:

    ```json
    {
      "key1": "value1",
      "key2": false,
      "key3": 42
    }
    ```


    Here is an example with inlined data:

    ```bash
    # Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive
    curl -X POST -H "X-API-Token: yourToken" -H  "Content-Type: application/json"
    https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}
      -d '{ "displayName": "new name", "enabled": false, "directives": "directiveId"}'
    ```

    You can also pass a supply the JSON in a file:

    ```bash
    # Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive
    curl -X POST -H "X-API-Token: yourToken" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id} -d @jsonParam
    ```

    Note that the general parameters view in the previous chapter cannot be passed in a JSON, and you will need to pass them a URL parameters if you want them to be taken into account (you can't mix JSON and request parameters):

    ```bash
    # Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive with reason message "Reason used"
    curl -X POST -H "X-API-Token: yourToken" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}?reason=Reason used" -d @jsonParam -d "reason=Reason ignored"
    ```

    ##### Request parameters

    In some cases, when you have little, simple data to update, JSON can feel bloated. In such cases, you can use
    request parameters. You will need to pass one parameter for each data you want to change.

    Parameters follow the following schema:

    ```
    key=value
    ```

    You can pass parameters by two means:

    * As query parameters: At the end of your url, put a **?** then your first parameter and then a **&** before next parameters. In that case, parameters need to be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding[URL encoded]

    ```bash
    # Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive
    curl -X POST -H "X-API-Token: yourToken"  https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}?"displayName=my new name"&"enabled=false"&"directives=aDirectiveId"
    ```

    * As request data: You can pass those parameters in the request data, they won't figure in the URL, making it lighter to read, You can pass a file that contains data.

    ```bash
    # Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive (in file directive-info.json)
    curl -X POST -H "X-API-Token: yourToken"
    https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id} -d "displayName=my new name" -d "enabled=false" -d @directive-info.json
    ```

If you don't provide a base level, they will be added to `default` level, so if you only want os details, use `minimal,os` as the value for this parameter.
          * **minimal** includes: `id`, `hostname` and `status`
          * **default** includes **minimal** plus `architectureDescription`, `description`, `ipAddresses`, `lastRunDate`, `lastInventoryDate`, `machine`, `os`, `managementTechnology`, `policyServerId`, `properties` (be careful! Only node own properties, if you also need inherited properties, look at the dedicated `/nodes/{id}/inheritedProperties` endpoint), `policyMode `, `ram` and `timezone`
          * **full** includes: **default** plus `accounts`, `bios`, `controllers`, `environmentVariables`, `fileSystems`, `managementTechnologyDetails`, `memories`, `networkInterfaces`, `ports`, `processes`, `processors`, `slots`, `software`, `sound`, `storage`, `videos` and `virtualMachines`

    API-Tokens:
      description: |-
        Apart for the status API, authenticating is mandatory for every request, as sensitive information like inventories or configuration rules may get exposed. It is done using a dedicated API account, than can be created in the web interface on the 'API accounts' page located inside the Administration part.

        ![API Tokens settings](assets/APISettings.png "API tokens settings")

        API accounts are not linked to standard user accounts, and currently give full administrative privileges: they must be secured adequately. Once you have created an API account, you get a token that will be needed to authenticate every request. This token is the API equivalent of a password, and must be secured just like a password would be.

        On any call to the API, you will need to add a **X-API-Token** header to your request to authenticate:


            curl --request GET --header "X-API-Token: yourToken" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/latest/rules


        If you perform any action (creation, update, deletion) using the API, the event log generated will record the API account as the user.
      in: header
      name: X-API-Token
      type: apiKey
