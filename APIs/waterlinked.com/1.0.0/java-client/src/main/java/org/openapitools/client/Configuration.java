/*
 * The Water Linked Underwater GPS API
 * API for the Water Linked Underwater GPS. For more details: http://www.waterlinked.com  Recommended approach for connecting to a Underwater GPS via the API is: - If \"GET /api/\" times out, the Underwater GPS is not running (on this IP address) - If \"GET /api/\" responds with 200 OK check that the api version returrned (eg \"v1\") is supported by the client (eg: also supports \"v1\"). - If the api version returned does not match what the client supports: give an error to the user and recommend upgrading. (Eg: response is \"v2\" while client only supports \"v1\") - If \"GET /api/\" responds with 301 Moved permanently. \"GET /api/v1/version\" to check if the kit has a version earlier than 1.5. - \"GET /api/v1/version\" will always respond with 200 OK on Underwater GPS earlier than 1.5 release.  Configuration API is is not considered stable and will potentially be changed
