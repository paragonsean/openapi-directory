        The *access token* obtained with this request can then be used in
        an `Access-Token` HTTP header or in a `token` URL query parameter
        in requests that require authentication.

        The *refresh token* can be used with `/auth/refresh` when the *access
        token* expires to retrieve a new *access token*. The lifetime of the
        refresh token is the maximum lifetime of this authentication request.

        The default lifetime of the *refresh token* is defined by the `appId`
        used. The `ttl` input parameter allows to request a *refresh token*
        with a shorter lifetime.

        To implement *logout*, use `/auth/revoke`.

        Get the mapping of virtual electricity flows to functionalities.

        Some rules are applied to expand the virtual flows using the concrete
        flows available.

        The `factor` tells how each energy value coming from a functionality
        must be added with values from other functionality to compute the
        energy of the virtual flow. Factors are usually `1` or `-1`.

        The `code` property gives the result which may be partial:
        - If all flows are available, `200000` is returned.
        - If no flows are available (indicating that the place has no
          electricity functionality or that no functionality has been attached
          to a flow), the `code` is `200001`. The `missing` property contains
          all the requested flows.
        - If some flows are missing, the `code` is `200002` and the `missing`
          property lists them.
