# openapi-java-client

Test the ExhibitDay API with Swagger
- API version: v1
  - Build date: 2024-10-12T09:57:30.634016-04:00[America/New_York]
  - Generator version: 7.9.0

This API can be used to programmatically pull data out of ExhibitDay or push data into ExhibitDay -- allowing for automation between ExhibitDay and your internal systems (or other third-party software). To use the API, you'll need working knowledge of consuming REST APIs.<br /><br />Docs: https://api.exhibitday.com/swagger/docs/v1


*Automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech)*


## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:
1. Java 1.8+
2. Maven (3.8.3+)/Gradle (7.2+)

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId>
  <artifactId>openapi-java-client</artifactId>
  <version>v1</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()     // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to maven central.
    mavenLocal()       // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to the local maven repo.
  }

  dependencies {
     implementation "org.openapitools:openapi-java-client:v1"
  }
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

* `target/openapi-java-client-v1.jar`
* `target/lib/*.jar`

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.model.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.EventsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://api.exhibitday.com");

    EventsApi apiInstance = new EventsApi(defaultClient);
    String apiKey = "apiKey_example"; // String | 
    String filterByEventNameContainsText = "filterByEventNameContainsText_example"; // String | Only include events that have the given text in the event Name. For example: If you want to retrieve all the events that have the word “International” in the event Name field, pass in the value “International” for the filter_by_event_name_contains_text parameter. Note: this text search is not case-sensitive.
    LocalDate filterByStartDateGreaterThanOrEqualTo = LocalDate.now(); // LocalDate | Only include events that have their start date greater than or equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. Use this date format: YYYY-MM-DD
    LocalDate filterByStartDateSmallerThanOrEqualTo = LocalDate.now(); // LocalDate | Only include events that have their start date smaller than or equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. Use this date format: YYYY-MM-DD
    LocalDate filterByEndDateGreaterThanOrEqualTo = LocalDate.now(); // LocalDate | Only include events that have their end date greater than or equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. Use this date format: YYYY-MM-DD
    LocalDate filterByEndDateSmallerThanOrEqualTo = LocalDate.now(); // LocalDate | Only include events that have their end date smaller than or equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. Use this date format: YYYY-MM-DD
    BigDecimal filterByEventParticipationTypeId = new BigDecimal(78); // BigDecimal | Only include events that have their participation_type_id equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. To get a list of available event Participation Type Ids in your workspace, refer to this endpoint: /v1/references/event_participation_types
    BigDecimal filterByEventFormatId = new BigDecimal(78); // BigDecimal | Only include events that have their format_id equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. The following integer values are accepted (1 for In-Person, 2 for Virtual, 3 for Hybrid)
    BigDecimal filterByEventStarRating = new BigDecimal(78); // BigDecimal | Only include events that have their star rating equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. The following integer values are accepted: 0, 1, 2, 3
    String filterByEventTag = "filterByEventTag_example"; // String | Only include events that have this tag. For example, you can use this filter to get all the events that have the tag “International”. Note: You can only pass in one tag to filter based on.
    String filterByCustomEventFieldCustomNNNNNN = "filterByCustomEventFieldCustomNNNNNN_example"; // String | This is a special filter that lets you filter down your events based on a value of a Custom Text field or a Custom Dropdown field under the Event Information tab, Event Booth tab, or the Special Event tab. To use this filter, you’ll need the field name for the custom text field or custom dropdown field. You can obtain a list of field names for custom event fields in your workspace from the following endpoint: /v1/references/event_custom_fields. For example, if you have configured a custom dropdown field called “Region” under the Event information tab, and its field name is “custom_123456” and you would like to filter your events to include only ones that have “Northeast” selected for that custom dropdown field, pass in “filter_by_custom_event_field__custom_123456” as the parameter name and “Northeast” as its parameter value. Note: You can only filter down based on one custom event field (and it has to be either a custom text field or a custom dropdown field).
    String filterByIntegrationMetadataField1 = "filterByIntegrationMetadataField1_example"; // String | Only include events that have their integration_metadata_field_1 property equal to the value you pass in for this parameter. Note: An event's integration_metadata_field_1 property is an integration-specific text field only accessible via the ExhibitDay API. This field is typically used to store metadata or information about a particular event (e.g., the \"external id\" of the event from another system you're integrating with).
    String filterByIntegrationMetadataField2 = "filterByIntegrationMetadataField2_example"; // String | Only include events that have their integration_metadata_field_2 property equal to the value you pass in for this parameter. Note: An event's integration_metadata_field_2 property is an integration-specific text field only accessible via the ExhibitDay API. This field is typically used to store metadata or information about a particular event (e.g., the \"external id\" of the event from another system you're integrating with).
    String filterByIntegrationMetadataField3 = "filterByIntegrationMetadataField3_example"; // String | Only include events that have their integration_metadata_field_3 property equal to the value you pass in for this parameter. Note: An event's integration_metadata_field_3 property is an integration-specific text field only accessible via the ExhibitDay API. This field is typically used to store metadata or information about a particular event (e.g., the \"external id\" of the event from another system you're integrating with).
    String filterByIntegrationMetadataField4 = "filterByIntegrationMetadataField4_example"; // String | Only include events that have their integration_metadata_field_4 property equal to the value you pass in for this parameter. Note: An event's integration_metadata_field_4 property is an integration-specific text field only accessible via the ExhibitDay API. This field is typically used to store metadata or information about a particular event (e.g., the \"external id\" of the event from another system you're integrating with).
    String filterByIntegrationMetadataField5 = "filterByIntegrationMetadataField5_example"; // String | Only include events that have their integration_metadata_field_5 property equal to the value you pass in for this parameter. Note: An event's integration_metadata_field_5 property is an integration-specific text field only accessible via the ExhibitDay API. This field is typically used to store metadata or information about a particular event (e.g., the \"external id\" of the event from another system you're integrating with).
    String hydrateTasks = "false"; // String | Include the tasks collection for each event in the result set. Note: hydrating the task collection for each event in the results will naturally yield a larger response size and response time. Set the value for this parameter to true only if you need to include the list of tasks for each event in the result set.
    String hydrateTaskSectionsList = "false"; // String | Include the list of available task sections for each event in the result set. Note: hydrating the event task section collection for each event in the results will naturally yield a larger response size and response time. Set the value for this parameter to true only if you need to include the list of task sections for each event in the result set.
    String hydrateCustomFields = "false"; // String | Include the event custom fields (i.e. custom fields that have been added to your workspace) for each event in the result set. Note: hydrating the event custom field collection for each event in the results will naturally yield a larger response size and response time. Set the value for this parameter to true only if you need to include the custom field values for each event in the result set.
    try {
      String result = apiInstance.events0Get(apiKey, filterByEventNameContainsText, filterByStartDateGreaterThanOrEqualTo, filterByStartDateSmallerThanOrEqualTo, filterByEndDateGreaterThanOrEqualTo, filterByEndDateSmallerThanOrEqualTo, filterByEventParticipationTypeId, filterByEventFormatId, filterByEventStarRating, filterByEventTag, filterByCustomEventFieldCustomNNNNNN, filterByIntegrationMetadataField1, filterByIntegrationMetadataField2, filterByIntegrationMetadataField3, filterByIntegrationMetadataField4, filterByIntegrationMetadataField5, hydrateTasks, hydrateTaskSectionsList, hydrateCustomFields);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling EventsApi#events0Get");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();

## Documentation for Authorization

Endpoints do not require authorization.


## Recommendation

It's recommended to create an instance of `ApiClient` per thread in a multithreaded environment to avoid any potential issues.
