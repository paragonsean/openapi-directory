## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install test_the_exhibit_day_api_with_swagger --save
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your test_the_exhibit_day_api_with_swagger from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### git

If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var TestTheExhibitDayApiWithSwagger = require('test_the_exhibit_day_api_with_swagger');


var api = new TestTheExhibitDayApiWithSwagger.EventsApi()
var apiKey = "apiKey_example"; // {String} 
var opts = {
  'filterByEventNameContainsText': "filterByEventNameContainsText_example", // {String} Only include events that have the given text in the event Name. For example: If you want to retrieve all the events that have the word “International” in the event Name field, pass in the value “International” for the filter_by_event_name_contains_text parameter. Note: this text search is not case-sensitive.
  'filterByStartDateGreaterThanOrEqualTo': new Date("2013-10-20"), // {Date} Only include events that have their start date greater than or equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. Use this date format: YYYY-MM-DD
  'filterByStartDateSmallerThanOrEqualTo': new Date("2013-10-20"), // {Date} Only include events that have their start date smaller than or equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. Use this date format: YYYY-MM-DD
  'filterByEndDateGreaterThanOrEqualTo': new Date("2013-10-20"), // {Date} Only include events that have their end date greater than or equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. Use this date format: YYYY-MM-DD
  'filterByEndDateSmallerThanOrEqualTo': new Date("2013-10-20"), // {Date} Only include events that have their end date smaller than or equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. Use this date format: YYYY-MM-DD
  'filterByEventParticipationTypeId': 3.4, // {Number} Only include events that have their participation_type_id equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. To get a list of available event Participation Type Ids in your workspace, refer to this endpoint: /v1/references/event_participation_types
  'filterByEventFormatId': 3.4, // {Number} Only include events that have their format_id equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. The following integer values are accepted (1 for In-Person, 2 for Virtual, 3 for Hybrid)
  'filterByEventStarRating': 3.4, // {Number} Only include events that have their star rating equal to the value passed in for this filter parameter. The following integer values are accepted: 0, 1, 2, 3
  'filterByEventTag': "filterByEventTag_example", // {String} Only include events that have this tag. For example, you can use this filter to get all the events that have the tag “International”. Note: You can only pass in one tag to filter based on.
  'filterByCustomEventFieldCustomNNNNNN': "filterByCustomEventFieldCustomNNNNNN_example", // {String} This is a special filter that lets you filter down your events based on a value of a Custom Text field or a Custom Dropdown field under the Event Information tab, Event Booth tab, or the Special Event tab. To use this filter, you’ll need the field name for the custom text field or custom dropdown field. You can obtain a list of field names for custom event fields in your workspace from the following endpoint: /v1/references/event_custom_fields. For example, if you have configured a custom dropdown field called “Region” under the Event information tab, and its field name is “custom_123456” and you would like to filter your events to include only ones that have “Northeast” selected for that custom dropdown field, pass in “filter_by_custom_event_field__custom_123456” as the parameter name and “Northeast” as its parameter value. Note: You can only filter down based on one custom event field (and it has to be either a custom text field or a custom dropdown field).
  'filterByIntegrationMetadataField1': "filterByIntegrationMetadataField1_example", // {String} Only include events that have their integration_metadata_field_1 property equal to the value you pass in for this parameter. Note: An event's integration_metadata_field_1 property is an integration-specific text field only accessible via the ExhibitDay API. This field is typically used to store metadata or information about a particular event (e.g., the \"external id\" of the event from another system you're integrating with).
  'filterByIntegrationMetadataField2': "filterByIntegrationMetadataField2_example", // {String} Only include events that have their integration_metadata_field_2 property equal to the value you pass in for this parameter. Note: An event's integration_metadata_field_2 property is an integration-specific text field only accessible via the ExhibitDay API. This field is typically used to store metadata or information about a particular event (e.g., the \"external id\" of the event from another system you're integrating with).
  'filterByIntegrationMetadataField3': "filterByIntegrationMetadataField3_example", // {String} Only include events that have their integration_metadata_field_3 property equal to the value you pass in for this parameter. Note: An event's integration_metadata_field_3 property is an integration-specific text field only accessible via the ExhibitDay API. This field is typically used to store metadata or information about a particular event (e.g., the \"external id\" of the event from another system you're integrating with).
  'filterByIntegrationMetadataField4': "filterByIntegrationMetadataField4_example", // {String} Only include events that have their integration_metadata_field_4 property equal to the value you pass in for this parameter. Note: An event's integration_metadata_field_4 property is an integration-specific text field only accessible via the ExhibitDay API. This field is typically used to store metadata or information about a particular event (e.g., the \"external id\" of the event from another system you're integrating with).
  'filterByIntegrationMetadataField5': "filterByIntegrationMetadataField5_example", // {String} Only include events that have their integration_metadata_field_5 property equal to the value you pass in for this parameter. Note: An event's integration_metadata_field_5 property is an integration-specific text field only accessible via the ExhibitDay API. This field is typically used to store metadata or information about a particular event (e.g., the \"external id\" of the event from another system you're integrating with).
  'hydrateTasks': "'false'", // {String} Include the tasks collection for each event in the result set. Note: hydrating the task collection for each event in the results will naturally yield a larger response size and response time. Set the value for this parameter to true only if you need to include the list of tasks for each event in the result set.
  'hydrateTaskSectionsList': "'false'", // {String} Include the list of available task sections for each event in the result set. Note: hydrating the event task section collection for each event in the results will naturally yield a larger response size and response time. Set the value for this parameter to true only if you need to include the list of task sections for each event in the result set.
  'hydrateCustomFields': "'false'" // {String} Include the event custom fields (i.e. custom fields that have been added to your workspace) for each event in the result set. Note: hydrating the event custom field collection for each event in the results will naturally yield a larger response size and response time. Set the value for this parameter to true only if you need to include the custom field values for each event in the result set.
};
var callback = function(error, data, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
};
api.events0Get(apiKey, opts, callback);
