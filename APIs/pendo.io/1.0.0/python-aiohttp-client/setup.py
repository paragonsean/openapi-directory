    ## Who is this for?  This documentation is for developers creating their own integration with [Feedback&#39;s](https://www.pendo.io/product/feedback/) API. If you are doing a standard integration, there&#39;s a really easy [Javascript integration](https://help.receptive.io/hc/en-us/articles/209221969-How-to-integrate-Receptive-with-your-app) that you should know about before you go to the effort of building your own integration.  ## Authentication  API calls generally need to be authenticated. Generate an API Key at https://feedback.pendo.io/app/#/vendor/settings?section&#x3D;integrate. This key should then be added to every request as a request header named &#39;auth-token&#39; (preferred), or as a query parameter named &#39;auth-token&#39;.  ## Endpoint  API endpoint is https://api.feedback.eu.pendo.io / https://api.feedback.us.pendo.io depending where your datacenter is located.  ## Notes  API endpoints are being added to this documentation as needed by customers. If you don&#39;t see an endpoint you need please contact support and if it exists we&#39;ll publish the docs here. The &#39;try it out&#39; feature on this documentation page will probably be blocked by your browser because the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header has its value set by the Feedback server depending on your hostname.  ## Generating client code  This documentation is automatically generated from an OpenAPI spec available [here](http://apidoc.receptive.io/receptive.swagger.json). You can use Swagger to auto-generate API client code in many languages using the [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/)
