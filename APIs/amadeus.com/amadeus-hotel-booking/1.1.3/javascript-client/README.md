HotelBooking - JavaScript client for hotel_booking

Before using this API, we recommend you read our **[Authorization Guide](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/apis-docs/guides/authorization-262)** for more information on how to generate an access token. 

Please also be aware that our test environment is based on a subset of the production for this API it may change dynamically. For your tests, use big cities like LON (London) or NYC (New-York).


**Warning: Do not perform test booking in production**. All requests are sent and processed by hotel providers. An excessive amount of fake/canceled reservation will make you blacklisted by hotel providers.

## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install hotel_booking --save
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your hotel_booking from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### git

If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var HotelBooking = require('hotel_booking');


var api = new HotelBooking.BookingApi()
var requestBody = new HotelBooking.BookingSchema(); // {BookingSchema} `offerId`, `guests`, `payments` and optional `rooms` for the repartition (when used the `rooms` array items must match the shopping offer `roomQuantity`) 
var opts = {
  'amaClientRef': "amaClientRef_example", // {String} Client Reference to track Request/Response
  'acceptEncoding': "acceptEncoding_example" // {String} Compress the Response
};
var callback = function(error, data, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
};
api.createBooking(requestBody, opts, callback);

```
