## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:
1. Java 1.8+
2. Maven (3.8.3+)/Gradle (7.2+)

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

### Maven users

Add this dependency to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId>
  <artifactId>openapi-java-client</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.6</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()     // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to maven central.
    mavenLocal()       // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to the local maven repo.
  }

  dependencies {
     implementation "org.openapitools:openapi-java-client:1.0.6"
  }
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

* `target/openapi-java-client-1.0.6.jar`
* `target/lib/*.jar`

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.model.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.FlightDestinationsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1");

    FlightDestinationsApi apiInstance = new FlightDestinationsApi(defaultClient);
    String origin = "MAD"; // String | IATA code of the city from which the flight will depart  [IATA table codes](http://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/code-search.aspx) - e.g. MAD for Madrid 
    String departureDate = "departureDate_example"; // String | The date, or range of dates, on which the flight will depart from the origin. Dates are specified in the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. 2017-12-25.   Ranges are specified with a comma and are inclusive  Departure date can not be more than 180 days in the future. 
    Boolean oneWay = false; // Boolean | if this parameter is set to true, only one-way flights are considered. If this parameter is not set or set to false, only round-trip flights are considered
    String duration = "duration_example"; // String | Exact duration or range of durations of the travel, in days.  This parameter must not be set if oneWay is true.   Ranges are specified with a comma and are inclusive, e.g. 2,8  Duration can not be lower than 1 days or higher than 15 days 
    Boolean nonStop = false; // Boolean | if this parameter is set to true, only flights going from the origin to the destination with no stop in-between are considered
    Long maxPrice = 56L; // Long | defines the price limit for each offer returned. The value should be a positive number, without decimals
    String viewBy = "COUNTRY"; // String | view the flight destinations by DATE, DESTINATION, DURATION, WEEK, or COUNTRY. View by DATE (default when oneWay is true) to get the cheapest flight destination for every departure date in the given range. View by DURATION (default when oneWay is false) to get the cheapest flight destination for every departure date and for every duration in the given ranges. View by WEEK to get the cheapest flight destination for every week in the given range of departure dates. View by COUNTRY to get the cheapest flight destination by country. Note that specifying a detailed view but large ranges may result in a huge number of flight destinations being returned. For some very large numbers of flight destinations, the API may refuse to provide a response
    try {
      FlightDestinations result = apiInstance.getFlightDestinations(origin, departureDate, oneWay, duration, nonStop, maxPrice, viewBy);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling FlightDestinationsApi#getFlightDestinations");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

```

## Documentation for Authorization

Endpoints do not require authorization.


## Recommendation

It's recommended to create an instance of `ApiClient` per thread in a multithreaded environment to avoid any potential issues.
