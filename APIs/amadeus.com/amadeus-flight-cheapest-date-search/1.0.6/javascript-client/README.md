## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install flight_cheapest_date_search --save
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your flight_cheapest_date_search from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### git

If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var FlightCheapestDateSearch = require('flight_cheapest_date_search');


var api = new FlightCheapestDateSearch.FlightDatesApi()
var origin = "MAD"; // {String} IATA code of the city from which the flight will depart  [IATA table codes](http://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/code-search.aspx) - e.g. MAD for Madrid 
var destination = "MUC"; // {String} IATA code of the city to which the flight is going.  [IATA table codes](http://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/code-search.aspx) - e.g. MUC for Munich 
var opts = {
  'departureDate': "departureDate_example", // {String} the date, or range of dates, on which the flight will depart from the origin. Dates are specified in the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. 2017-12-25. Ranges are specified with a comma and are inclusive
  'oneWay': false, // {Boolean} if this parameter is set to true, only one-way flights are considered. If this parameter is not set or set to false, only round-trip flights are considered
  'duration': "duration_example", // {String} exact duration or range of durations of the travel, in days. This parameter must not be set if oneWay is true. Ranges are specified with a comma and are inclusive, e.g. 2,8
  'nonStop': false, // {Boolean} if this parameter is set to true, only flights going from the origin to the destination with no stop in-between are considered
  'maxPrice': 789, // {Number} defines the price limit for each offer returned. The value should be a positive number, without decimals
  'viewBy': "viewBy_example" // {String} view the flight dates by DATE, DURATION, or WEEK. View by DATE (default when oneWay is true) to get the cheapest flight dates for every departure date in the given range. View by DURATION (default when oneWay is false) to get the cheapest flight dates for every departure date and for every duration in the given ranges. View by WEEK to get the cheapest flight destination for every week in the given range of departure dates. Note that specifying a detailed view but large ranges may result in a huge number of flight dates being returned. For some very large numbers of flight dates, the API may refuse to provide a response
};
var callback = function(error, data, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
};
api.getFlightDates(origin, destination, opts, callback);

```
