        \ parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets\
        \ are available:\n\n#### Summary Fields Set\n\nThe **summary_set** query string\
        \ parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that\
        \ are often used to build \nsearch response results. The following fields\
        \ are provided for every image in your result set when you include **summary_set**\
        \ in your request.\n\n```\n{\n    \"images\":\n    [\n        \"artist\",\n\
        \        \"asset_family\",\n        \"caption\",\n        \"collection_code\"\

        ,\n        \"max_dimensions\",\n        \"title\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Detail\
        \ Fields Set\n\nThe **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents\
        \ a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a \ndetailed\
        \ view of images. The following fields are provided for every image in your\
        \ result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.\n\n```\n{\n\
        \    \"images\":\n    [\n        \"allowed_use\",\n        \"artist\", \n\
        \        \"artist_title\", \n        \"asset_family\",\n        \"call_for_image\"\

        ,\n        \"state_province\", \n        \"title\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n####\
        \ Display Fields Set\n\nThe **display_set** query string parameter fields\
        \ value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution\n\
        files that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results.\
        \ The following fields are provided for every image \nin your result set when\
        \ you include **display_set** in your request.\n\nThe URI provided is subject\
        \ to change at any time and must be used as-is with no modification.\n\n```\n\
        {\n    \"images\":\n    [\n        \"display_sizes\": \n        [\n      \
        \      {\n                \"is_watermarked\": <boolean>,\n               \
        \ \"name\": \"comp\",\n                \"uri\": \"<link>\"\n            },\n\
        \            {\n                \"is_watermarked\": <boolean>,\n         \
        \       \"name\": \"preview\",\n                \"uri\": \"<link>\"\n    \

        \n            }\n        ]\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Request Usage Considerations\n\
        \n- Specifying the \"entity_details\" response field can have significant\
        \ performance implications. The field should be used only when necessary.\n"

        \ For these reasons,_ _**it is highly recommended that those endpoints are\
        \ used instead of this blended endpoint.**_\n\n\n\nYou'll need an API key\
        \ and access token to use this resource.\n\nYou can show different information\
        \ in the response by specifying values on the \"fields\" parameter (see details\
        \ below).\nYou can search with only an API key, and that will give you search\

        \ without a phrase parameter are not supported and may not always work.\n\n\
        ## Working with Fields Sets\n\nFields sets are used in the **fields** request\
        \ parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets\
        \ are available:\n\n#### Summary Fields Set\n\nThe **summary_set** query string\
        \ parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that\
        \ are often used to build search response results. The following fields are\
        \ provided for every image in your result set when you include **summary_set**\
        \ in your request.\n\n```\n{\n    \"images\": \n    [\n        \"asset_family\"\
        ,\n        \"caption\",\n        \"collection_code\",\n        \"collection_id\"\
        ,\n        \"collection_name\",\n        \"display_sizes\": \n        [\n\
        \            {\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\n            }\n     \
        \   ],\n        \"license_model\",\n        \"max_dimensions\",\n        \"\
        title\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Detail Fields Set\n\nThe **detail_set** query\
        \ string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields\
        \ that are often used to build a detailed view of images. \nThe following\
        \ fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include\
        \ **detail_set** in your request.\n\n```\n{\n    \"images\": \n    [\n   \
        \     \"allowed_use\",\n        \"artist\",\n        \"asset_family\",\n \
        \       \"call_for_image\",\n        \"caption\",\n        \"collection_code\"\
        ,\n        \"collection_id\",\n        \"collection_name\",\n        \"copyright\"\
        ,\n        \"date_created\",\n        \"display_sizes\": \n        [\n   \
        \         {\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\n            },\n        \
        \    {\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\n            },\n          \
        \  {\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\n            }\n        ],\n   \
        \     \"editorial_segments\",\n        \"event_ids\",\n        \"graphical_style\"\
        ,\n        \"license_model\",\n        \"max_dimensions\",\n        \"orientation\"\
        ,\n        \"product_types\",\n        \"quality_rank\",\n        \"referral_destinations\"\
        ,\n        \"title\"\n    ]\n]\n```\n\n#### Display Fields Set\n\nThe **display_set**\
        \ query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you\
        \ with URLs for the low resolution files that are most \nfrequently used to\
        \ build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided\
        \ for every image in your result set when you include **display_set**\nin\
        \ your request.\n\nThe URI provided is subject to change at any time and must\
        \ be used as-is with no modification.\n\n```\n{\n    \"images\":\n    [\n\
        \        \"display_sizes\": \n        [\n            {\n                \"\
        is_watermarked\": <boolean>,\n                \"name\": \"comp\",\n      \
        \          \"uri\": \"<link>\"\n            },\n            {\n          \
        \      \"is_watermarked\": <boolean>,\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\
        ,\n                \"uri\": \"<link>\"\n            },\n            {\n  \
        \              \"is_watermarked\": <boolean>,\n                \"name\": \"\
        thumb\",\n                \"uri\": \"<link>\"\n            }\n        ]\n\
        \    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Request Usage Considerations\n\n- Specifying the \"entity_details\"\
        \ response field can have significant performance implications. The field\
        \ should be used only when necessary.\n"

        Search for **similar creative images** by passing an `image_url` to an uploaded image OR an `asset_id` of an asset in our catalog.  All responses will have the `exclude_nudity` filter automatically applied.

        ## Searching by URL

        Before calling the search by image endpoint, an image in JPEG format must be uploaded to `https://api.gettyimages.com/v3/search/by-image/uploads/{CLIENT_IMAGE.jpg}`, where the client defines the `{CLIENT_IMAGE.jpg}` portion of the URL.

        For example, using cURL:

        ``` sh
        curl -i -X PUT https://api.gettyimages.com/v3/search/by-image/uploads/my-test-image.jpg -H 'Content-Type: image/jpeg' -H 'Api-Key: API_KEY' --data-binary "@testimage.jpg"
        ```

        Once the image has been uploaded, use the full URL in the `image_url` parameter, e.g. `image_url=https://api.gettyimages.com/v3/search/by-image/uploads/my-test-image.jpg`.

        - Uploaded files must be 10MB or smaller.
        - Uploads to the same URL will overwrite each other, so ensure that the client application is handling naming uniqueness appropriately.
        - Uploads expire after 24 hours.
        - Uploads and searches must be performed using the _same_ API Key.

        ## Searching by asset id

        When searching by `asset_id`, any image or video asset id in the Getty/iStock catalog can be used as the source for similar images.

        \ generally intended for editorial use.\n\nYou'll need an API key and access\
        \ token to use this resource.\n\nYou can show different information in the\
        \ response by specifying values on the \"fields\" parameter (see details below).\n\
        You can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results\
        \ that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without\
        \ being logged in (anonymous search).  If you are a Getty Images API customer\

        \ you have a license to use, you need to also include an authorization token\

        \ for more information on authorization tokens, and our [Authorization Workflows](https://github.com/gettyimages/gettyimages-api/blob/master/OAuth2Workflow.md)\

        \n#### Summary Fields Set\n\nThe **summary_set** query string parameter fields\
        \ value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to\
        \ build search response results. The following fields are provided for every\
        \ image in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\n\

        \ Fields Set\n\nThe **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents\
        \ a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a detailed\
        \ view of images. The following fields are provided for every image in your\

        #### Display Fields Set\n\nThe **display_set** query string parameter fields\
        \ value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution\
        \ files that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results.\
        \ The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when\
        \ you include **display_set** in your request.\n\nThe URI provided is subject\

        \n#### Summary Fields Set\n\nThe **summary_set** query string parameter fields\
        \ value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to\
        \ build search\nresponse results. The following fields are provided for every\
        \ video in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\n\

        \   ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Detail Fields Set\n\nThe **detail_set** query string\
        \ parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that\
        \ are often used to build a \ndetailed view of videos. The following fields\
        \ are provided for every video in your result set when you include **detail_set**\
        \ in your request.\n\n```\n{\n    \"videos\": \n    [\n        \"allowed_use\"\

        title\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Display Fields Set\n\nThe **display_set** query\
        \ string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with\
        \ URLs for the low resolution files \nthat are most frequently used to build\
        \ a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every\
        \ video in your result \nset when you include **display_set** in your request.\n\
        \nThe URI provided is subject to change at any time and must be used as-is\
        \ with no modification.\n\n```\n{\n    \"videos\":\n    [\n        \"display_sizes\"\

    get:
      description: |
        Search for **similar creative videos** by passing an `image_url` to an uploaded image/frame grab from a video OR an `asset_id` of an asset in our catalog.  All responses will have the `exclude_nudity` filter automatically applied.

        ## Searching by URL

        Before calling the search by image endpoint, an image or frame grab in JPEG format must be uploaded to `https://api.gettyimages.com/v3/search/by-image/uploads/{CLIENT_IMAGE.jpg}`, where the client defines the `{CLIENT_IMAGE.jpg}` portion of the URL.

        For example, using cURL:

        ``` sh
        curl -i -X PUT https://api.gettyimages.com/v3/search/by-image/uploads/my-test-image.jpg -H 'Content-Type: image/jpeg' -H 'Api-Key: API_KEY' --data-binary "@testimage.jpg"
        ```

        Once the image has been uploaded, use the full URL in the `image_url` parameter, e.g. `image_url=https://api.gettyimages.com/v3/search/by-image/uploads/my-test-image.jpg`.

        - Uploaded files must be 10MB or smaller
        - Uploads to the same URL will overwrite each other, so ensure that the client application is handling naming uniqueness appropriately.
        - Uploads expire after 24 hours.
        - Uploads and searches must be performed using the _same_ API Key.

        ## Searching by asset id

        When searching by `asset_id`, any image or video asset id in the Getty/iStock catalog can be used as the source for similar videos.

        \ Fields Sets\n\nFields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter\
        \ to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:\n\
        \n#### Summary Fields Set\n\nThe **summary_set** query string parameter fields\
        \ value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to\
        \ build search response results. The following fields are provided for every\
        \ video in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\n\
        \n```\n{\n    \"videos\": \n    [\n        \"asset_family\", \n        \"\
        caption\",\n        \"collection_code\",\n        \"collection_name\",\n \
        \       \"display_sizes\":\n        [\n            {\n                \"name\"\
        : \"comp\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\
        \n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\n   \
        \         }\n        ],\n        \"license_model\",\n        \"title\"\n \
        \   ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Detail Fields Set\n\nThe **detail_set** query string\
        \ parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that\
        \ are often used to build a detailed view of videos. The following fields\
        \ are provided for every video in your result set when you include **detail_set**\
        \ in your request.\n\n```\n{\n    \"videos\": \n    [\n        \"allowed_use\"\
        ,\n        \"artist\",\n        \"asset_family\", \n\t\t\"call_for_image\"\
        ,\n        \"caption\", \n        \"clip_length\",\n        \"collection_code\"\
        ,\n        \"collection_id\",\n        \"collection_name\", \n        \"color_type\"\
        ,\n        \"copyright\",\n        \"date_created\",\n        \"display_sizes\"\
        :\n        [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\n        \
        \    },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\n          \
        \  },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\n            }\n\
        \        ],\n        \"era\",\n        \"event_ids\",\n        \"license_model\"\
        ,\n        \"mastered_to\",\n        \"originally_shot_on\",\n        \"product_types\"\
        ,\n        \"quality_rank\",\n        \"shot_speed\",\n        \"source\"\
        ,\n        \"title\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Display Fields Set\n\nThe **display_set**\
        \ query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you\
        \ with URLs for the low resolution files that are most frequently used to\
        \ build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided\
        \ for every video in your result set when you include **display_set** in your\
        \ request.\n\nThe URI provided is subject to change at any time and must be\
        \ used as-is with no modification.\n\n```\n{\n    \"videos\":\n    [\n   \
        \     \"display_sizes\": \n        [\n            {\n                \"is_watermarked\"\
        : <boolean>,\n                \"name\": \"comp\",\n                \"uri\"\
        : \"<link>\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"is_watermarked\"\
        : <boolean>,\n                \"name\": \"preview\",\n                \"uri\"\
        : \"<link>\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"is_watermarked\"\
