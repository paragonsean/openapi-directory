(Re)retrieve Response Result.

If you&#39;ve received a notification that you previously backgrounded transaction has completed, or you wish to re-retrive a result from an earlier transaction, then you can simply request the result from our encrypted cache  The response will return the original HTTP code, along with the payload that would have been returned in the original request. 

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.auth.*;
import org.openapitools.client.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.RetrieveApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://api.demo.frankiefinancial.io/compliance/v1.2");
    
    // Configure API key authorization: api_key
    ApiKeyAuth api_key = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("api_key");
    api_key.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //api_key.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    RetrieveApi apiInstance = new RetrieveApi(defaultClient);
    UUID xFrankieCustomerID = UUID.randomUUID(); // UUID | Customer ID issued by Frankie Financial. This will never change. Your API key, which is mapped to this identity, will change over time. 
    String requestId = "requestId_example"; // String | This will be the same RequestId that was sent in the 202 acceptance response. 
    UUID xFrankieCustomerChildID = UUID.randomUUID(); // UUID | If, as a Frankie Customer, you are acting on behalf of your own customers, then you can populate this field with a Frankie-assigned ID.  Note: If using a CustomerChildID, you will also need a separate api_key for each child.  Any documents, checks, entities that are created when this field has been populated will now be tied to this CustomerID + CustomerChildID combination. Just as Customers cannot see data created by other Customers, so too a Customer's Children will not be able to see each other's data.  A Customer can see the documents/entities and checks of all their Children. 
    String payload = "string"; // String | Specifies the type of the payload field in the retrieved response. Default is 'string'. 
    try {
      RetrievedResponseObject result = apiInstance.retrieveResult(xFrankieCustomerID, requestId, xFrankieCustomerChildID, payload);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling RetrieveApi#retrieveResult");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```
