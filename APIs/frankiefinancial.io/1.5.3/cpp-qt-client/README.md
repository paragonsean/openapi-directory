Sandbox base URL is:
  - https://api.demo.frankiefinancial.io/compliance/v1.2
  
  - We do have an old sandbox at https://sandbox.frankiefinancial.com/compliance/v1.2 but this has been retired.

  - All calls are the same as production, only with canned data. 

  - Full Swagger definition, along with test data for playing in the sandbox can be obtained once initial commercial discussions have commenced.

  - Production and optional UAT access will be opened up only to those with a signed commercial contract.

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIBusinessApi::businessOwnershipQuerySignal, [&]() {

      });
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIBusinessApi::businessOwnershipQuerySignalE, [&](QNetworkReply::NetworkError, QString error_str) {
          qDebug() << "Error happened while issuing request : " << error_str;
          loop.quit();
      });

      QString x_frankie_customer_id = create(); // QString | Customer ID issued by Frankie Financial. This will never change. Your API key, which is mapped to this identity, will change over time. 

      QEventLoop loop;

          loop.quit();
      });

      OAIOwnershipQuery query = create(); // OAIOwnershipQuery | The organisation to be queried. An entity object that must have an organisation object with at least one organisation number.

      QString x_frankie_customer_child_id = create(); // QString | If, as a Frankie Customer, you are acting on behalf of your own customers, then you can populate this field with a Frankie-assigned ID.  Note: If using a CustomerChildID, you will also need a separate api_key for each child.  Any documents, checks, entities that are created when this field has been populated will now be tied to this CustomerID + CustomerChildID combination. Just as Customers cannot see data created by other Customers, so too a Customer's Children will not be able to see each other's data.  A Customer can see the documents/entities and checks of all their Children. 

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIBusinessApi::businessOwnershipQuerySignal, [&]() {
          loop.quit();

      QSet<QString> check_type = create(); // QSet<QString> | When creating a new check, we need to define the checks we wish to run. If this parameter is not supplied then the check will be based on a configured check type for each entity category.    The checkType is make up of a comma separated list of the types of check we wish to run.  The order is important, and must be of the form:   - Entity Check (if you're running this). Choose one from the available options   - ID Check (If you want this)   - PEP Checks (again if you want this, choose one of the options)  Entity Checks - One of:   - \"one_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 1 data source. (also known as a 1+1)   - \"two_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 2 independent data sources (also known as a 2+2)  ID Checks - One of:   - \"id\": Checks all of the identity documents, but not necessarily the entity itself independently. Use this in conjunction with a one_plus or two_plus for more.    Fraud Checks - One or more  of:   - \"fraudlist\": Checks to see if the identity appears on any known fraud lists. Should be run after KYC/ID checks have passed.   - \"fraudid\": Checks external ID services to see if details appear in fraud detection services (e.g. EmailAge or FraudNet)    PEP Checks - One of:   - \"pep\": Will only run PEP/Sanctions checks (no identity verification)   - \"pep_media\": Will run PEP/Sanctions checks, as well as watchlist and adverse media checks. (no identity verification)      * NOTE: These checks will ONLY run if either the KYC/ID checks have been run prior, or it is the only check requested.    Pre-defined combinations:   - \"full\": equivalent to \"two_plus,id,pep_media\" or \"pep_media\" if the target is an organisation.   - \"default\": Currently defined as \"two_plus,id\" or \"pep\" if the target is an organisation.  Custom:   - By arrangement with Frankie you can define your own KYC check type.      This will allow you to set the minimum number of matches for:     - name      - date of birth     - address     - government id      This allows for alternatives to the \"standard\" two_plus or one_plus (note, these can be overridden too).    Profile:   - \"profile\": By arrangement with Frankie you can have a \"profile\" check type that applies checks according to a profile that you assign to the entity from a predefined set of profiles.      The profile to use will be taken from the entity.entityProfile field if set, or be run through a set of configurable rules to determine which one to use.      Profiles act a little like the Pre-defined combinations above in that they can map to a defined list. But they offer a lot more besides, including rules for determining default settings, inbuild data aging and other configurable features.   They also allow for a new result set top be returned that provides a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification process.      Entity Profiles are the future of checks with Frankie Financial.

Options are: - \"on\": Validate only when ACN is not provided. This is the typical default. - \"acn\": Validate even if ACN is provided. - \"only\": Like \"acn\" but only do validation query, don't proceed with ownership query. This option cannot be set as the default via configuration. - \"off\": Never validate. The Ownership query will then fail if an ACN is not provided.

## Documentation for Servers

Parameterized Servers are supported. Define a server in the API for each endpoint with arbitrary numbers of variables:

```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:{port}/{basePath}
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
    port:
      enum:
        - '3000'
        - '1000'
      default: '3000'
    basePath:
      default: v1
```
To change the default variable, use this function in each Api:
```c++
int setDefaultServerValue(int serverIndex,const QString &operation, const QString &variable,const QString &val);
```
The parameter "serverIndex" will choose a server from the server list for each endpoint. There is always at least one server with index 0. The Parameter "operation" should be the desired endpoint operationid.
Variable is the name of the variable you wish to change and the value is the new default Value.
The function will return -1 when the variable does not exists, -2 if value is not defined in the variable enum and -3 if the operation is not found.

If your endpoint has multiple server objects in the servers array, you can set the server that will be used with this function:
```c++
void setServerIndex(const QString &operation, int serverIndex);
```
Parameter "operation" should be your operationid. "serverIndex" is the index you want to set as your default server. The function will check if there is a server with your index.
Here is an example of multiple servers in the servers array. The first server will have index 0 and the second will have index 1.
```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:8080/
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
- url: https://localhost:8080/v1
```
