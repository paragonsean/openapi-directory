 * OAIEnumNotificationType.h
 *
 * Indicates the type of notification being pushed. - \&quot;FUNCTION\&quot;: A request that you previously backgrounded has completed and this is the notification that is it complete (success is another matter) - \&quot;RESULT\&quot;: Like the FUNCTION notification, this tells you that a previously backgrounded request has completed, and that there is a set of results in the payload pointer. - \&quot;EVENT\&quot;: There has been a stateful change in a document, entity or some other piece of data that we are holding/monitoring for you. This is an indication that you may wish to take some action. - \&quot;ALERT\&quot;: Like the EVENT, except that the severity of the notification indicates that action is almost certainly required.
