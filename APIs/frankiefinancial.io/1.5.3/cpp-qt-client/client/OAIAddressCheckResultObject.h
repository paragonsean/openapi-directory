/*
 * OAIAddressCheckResultObject.h
 *
 * This object holds the address that was checked and the results associated with said checks. You can also leave the checkResult blank/nil if there are no results for that address if you wish.  This is useful for returning results on a freshly crerated entity where the API user would want to confirm that the data has indeed been stored, and be able to capture relevant addressIDs - perhaps to address issues as to why it wasn&#39;t checked.
