          Any documents, checks, entities that are created when this field has been populated will now be tied to this CustomerID + CustomerChildID combination. Just as Customers cannot see data created by other Customers, so too a Customer's Children will not be able to see each other's data.

        Reports include:

        At a minimum, you just need to supply an ACN and/or ABN and an entity type set to ORGANISATION. Alternatively the entity ID of an existing ORGANISATION entity gan be given in the request body

        Note: these reports are different to the Ultimate Beneficial Owner and Business Detail requests - these reports are independent data and analysis over and above company information and verification details.

        You can request multiple reports to be run at once and they will be returned as a group (where feasible).

        If a report can only be generated over time, then a temporary response will be returned and a webhook notification will be pushed later once the report has been completed.

          * idType
          * country
          * idNumber

        The service will return a list of matching documents with confidence levels.

        If you are the "owner" of the document - i.e. the same CustomerID and CustomerChildID (if relevant) - then the full details of the document will be returned, except for the contents of any attached scans.
        If you are not the owner of the document, then just the ID and confidence level is returned. You can still use this ID to retrieve any check results (see GET /document/{documentId}/checks)

        Note: At this time, we cannot perform searches on document scans. But, you can supply extraData KVPs if they're known. These will help doublecheck search results with ambiguous results.

          Any documents, checks, entities that are created when this field has been populated will now be tied to this CustomerID + CustomerChildID combination. Just as Customers cannot see data created by other Customers, so too a Customer's Children will not be able to see each other's data.

          A Customer can see the documents/entities and checks of all their Children.

        Create an entity object. An entity object can be used to simply store data around a given identity. You can attach ID documents, scans, PDFs, photos, videos, etc to the entity if you wish and these may be processed later (using the /scan function) to extract useful information. Or you can manually supply the  information if you choose.

        If the entity is successfully created, take the details and documents provided, and set about verifying them all.
        So for example, you might extract:

        * The name from the entity.name object
        * The address from the entity.address object
        * The DoB..

        All documents that are attached to the entity will also be verified (if possible).

        You can also specify the level of detail returned using the resultLevel parameter. You can choose "summary" or "full". For the "profile" check type you can also select "simple" to only get the entity profile result.

        SPECIAL NOTE: A "Full" response includes details of all checks and how they map against each element, along with all the details of pep/sanctions/etc checks too.

        Your account also needs to be configured to support a full response too (talk to your account manager for more information). If you're not configured for full responses, we'll only return summary level data regardless.

          \ the types of check you wish to run. The order of the requested checks\
          \ is not important, they will be re-ordered by the service and in some cases,\
          \ depending on your account configuration, may be skipped.\n\n  The validation\
          \ that is performed on the requested checks is to:\n  - ensure the check\
          \ type is known\n  - is suitable for the type of entity (no KYC for organisations)\n\
          \  - disallow manual (mKYC) check with any other kind of KYC\n  - disallow\
          \ mixing the \"profile\" check with any other kind of check.\n\nThe supported\
          \ check types are:\n\nProfile:\n  - \"profile\": By arrangement with Frankie\
          \ we will create a \"profile\" check type that applies checks according\
          \ to a recipe that you assign to the entity from a predefined set of profiles.\n\
          \  \n  The profile to use will be taken from the entity.entityProfile field\
          \ if set, or be run through a set of configurable rules to determine which\
          \ one to use.\n  \n  Profiles provide a pre-defined combination of individual\
          \ checkTypes (see the list below). But they offer a lot more besides, including\
          \ rules for determining default settings, inbuilt data aging and other configurable\
          \ features.\n  They also allow for a new result set top be returned that\
          \ provides a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification\
          \ process.\n  \n  Entity Profiles are a recent feature (since v1.4.0) but\
          \ are now the default checkType to use with Frankie Financial.\n\n**Individual\
          \ Check Types**\n\nWhilst we strongly recommend the use of the \"profile\"\
          \ checktype, it does map of any combination of the types below. If you wish\
          \ to use these individually, please contact developer support for more details\
          \ on how to use these effectively.\n\nEntity Checks - One of:\n  - \"one_plus\"\
          : Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 1 data source. (also\
          \ known as a 1+1)\n  - \"two_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against\
          \ a minimum of 2 independent data sources (also known as a 2+2)\n\nID Checks\
          \ - One of:\n  - \"id\": Checks all of the identity documents, but not necessarily\
          \ the entity itself independently. Use this in conjunction with a one_plus\
          \ or two_plus for more.\n  - \"visa\":\n  \nID Validate - One of:\n  - \"\
          idvalidate\": Checks to see if photo ID has had OCR scanning, ID document\
          \ validation and photo comparison run against it. Can be used in conjunction\
          \ with any of the KYC/ID/AML checks.\n  \nManual Check:\n  - \"manual\"\
          : (mKYC) Checks user has a sufficient amount of operator verified ID and\
          \ will then \"pass\" all Entity and ID related checks.\n  \nFraud Checks\
          \ - One or more of:\n  - \"fraudlist\": Checks to see if the identity appears\
          \ on any known fraud lists. Should be run after KYC/ID checks have passed.\n\
          \  - \"fraudcheck\": Checks external ID services to see if details appear\
          \ in fraud detection services (e.g. EmailAge or FraudNet)\n  \nPEP Checks\
          \ - One of:\n  - \"pep\": Will only run PEP/Sanctions checks (no identity\
          \ verification)\n  - \"pep_media\": Will run PEP/Sanctions checks, as well\
          \ as watchlist and adverse media checks. (no identity verification)\n  \n\
          \  * NOTE: These checks will ONLY run if either the KYC/ID checks have been\
          \ run prior, or it is the only check requested.\n  \nCustom:\n  - By arrangement\
          \ with Frankie you can define your own KYC check type.\n  \n  This will\
          \ allow you to set the minimum number of matches for:\n    - name \n   \
          \ - date of birth\n    - address\n    - government id\n  \n  This allows\
          \ for alternatives to the \"standard\" two_plus or one_plus (note, these\
          \ can be overridden too).\n"

        Resolve the state of a pair of duplicate entities with the '?set=' query parameter as 'true' or 'false'.
        Setting duplicate to 'true' will make entityId invisible for most purposes and otherId will continue to function as normal.
        Setting duplicate to 'false' means the two entities are in fact separate but similar and they will both continue to exist independently but will no longer be identified as duplicates of eachother.

          If, as a Frankie Customer, you are acting on behalf of your own customers, then you can populate this field with a Frankie-assigned ID.

          Note: If using a CustomerChildID, you will also need a separate api_key for each child.

          Any documents, checks, entities that are created when this field has been populated will now be tied to this CustomerID + CustomerChildID combination. Just as Customers cannot see data created by other Customers, so too a Customer's Children will not be able to see each other's data.

          A Customer can see the documents/entities and checks of all their Children.

        Take the details and documents provided in the entity, and set about verifying them all.
        So for example, you might extract:

        * The name from the entity.name object
        * The address from the entity.address object
        * The DoB..

        All documents that are presently attached to the entity will also be verified (if requested)

        You can also specify the level of detail returned using the resultLevel parameter. You can choose "summary" or "full". For the "profile" check type you can also select "simple" to only get the entity profile result.

        SPECIAL NOTE: A "Full" response includes details of all checks and how they map against each element, along with all the details of pep/sanctions/etc checks too.

        Your account also needs to be configured to support a full response too (talk to your account manager for more information). If you're not configured for full responses, we'll only return summary level data regardless.

          \ is not important, they will be re-ordered by the service and in some cases,\
          \ depending on your account configuration, may be skipped.\n\n  The validation\
          \ that is performed on the requested checks is to:\n  - ensure the check\
          \ type is known\n  - is suitable for the type of entity (no KYC for organisations)\n\
          \  - disallow manual (mKYC) check with any other kind of KYC\n  - disallow\
          \ mixing the \"profile\" check with any other kind of check.\n\nThe supported\
          \ check types are:\n\nProfile:\n  - \"profile\": By arrangement with Frankie\
          \ we will create a \"profile\" check type that applies checks according\
          \ to a recipe that you assign to the entity from a predefined set of profiles.\n\
          \  \n  The profile to use will be taken from the entity.entityProfile field\
          \ if set, or be run through a set of configurable rules to determine which\
          \ one to use.\n  \n  Profiles provide a pre-defined combination of individual\
          \ checkTypes (see the list below). But they offer a lot more besides, including\
          \ rules for determining default settings, inbuilt data aging and other configurable\
          \ features.\n  They also allow for a new result set top be returned that\
          \ provides a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification\
          \ process.\n  \n  Entity Profiles are a recent feature (since v1.4.0) but\
          \ are now the default checkType to use with Frankie Financial.\n\n**Individual\
          \ Check Types**\n\nWhilst we strongly recommend the use of the \"profile\"\
          \ checktype, it does map of any combination of the types below. If you wish\
          \ to use these individually, please contact developer support for more details\
          \ on how to use these effectively.\n\nEntity Checks - One of:\n  - \"one_plus\"\
          : Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 1 data source. (also\
          \ known as a 1+1)\n  - \"two_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against\
          \ a minimum of 2 independent data sources (also known as a 2+2)\n\nID Checks\
          \ - One of:\n  - \"id\": Checks all of the identity documents, but not necessarily\
          \ the entity itself independently. Use this in conjunction with a one_plus\
          \ or two_plus for more.\n  - \"visa\":\n  \nID Validate - One of:\n  - \"\
          idvalidate\": Checks to see if photo ID has had OCR scanning, ID document\
          \ validation and photo comparison run against it. Can be used in conjunction\
          \ with any of the KYC/ID/AML checks.\n  \nManual Check:\n  - \"manual\"\
          : (mKYC) Checks user has a sufficient amount of operator verified ID and\
          \ will then \"pass\" all Entity and ID related checks.\n  \nFraud Checks\
          \ - One or more of:\n  - \"fraudlist\": Checks to see if the identity appears\
          \ on any known fraud lists. Should be run after KYC/ID checks have passed.\n\
          \  - \"fraudcheck\": Checks external ID services to see if details appear\
          \ in fraud detection services (e.g. EmailAge or FraudNet)\n  \nPEP Checks\
          \ - One of:\n  - \"pep\": Will only run PEP/Sanctions checks (no identity\
          \ verification)\n  - \"pep_media\": Will run PEP/Sanctions checks, as well\
          \ as watchlist and adverse media checks. (no identity verification)\n  \n\
          \  * NOTE: These checks will ONLY run if either the KYC/ID checks have been\
          \ run prior, or it is the only check requested.\n  \nCustom:\n  - By arrangement\

        \ on the requested checks is to:\n  - ensure the check type is known\n  -\
        \ is suitable for the type of entity (no KYC for organisations)\n  - disallow\
        \ manual (mKYC) check with any other kind of KYC\n  - disallow mixing the\
        \ \"profile\" check with any other kind of check.\n\nThe supported check types\
        \ are:\n\nProfile:\n  - \"profile\": By arrangement with Frankie we will create\
        \ a \"profile\" check type that applies checks according to a recipe that\
        \ you assign to the entity from a predefined set of profiles.\n  \n  The profile\
        \ to use will be taken from the entity.entityProfile field if set, or be run\
        \ through a set of configurable rules to determine which one to use.\n  \n\
        \  Profiles provide a pre-defined combination of individual checkTypes (see\
        \ the list below). But they offer a lot more besides, including rules for\
        \ determining default settings, inbuilt data aging and other configurable\
        \ features.\n  They also allow for a new result set top be returned that provides\
        \ a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification process.\n\
        \  \n  Entity Profiles are a recent feature (since v1.4.0) but are now the\
        \ default checkType to use with Frankie Financial.\n\n**Individual Check Types**\n\
        \nWhilst we strongly recommend the use of the \"profile\" checktype, it does\
        \ map of any combination of the types below. If you wish to use these individually,\
        \ please contact developer support for more details on how to use these effectively.\n\
        \nEntity Checks - One of:\n  - \"one_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB\
        \ against a minimum of 1 data source. (also known as a 1+1)\n  - \"two_plus\"\
        : Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 2 independent data sources\
        \ (also known as a 2+2)\n\nID Checks - One of:\n  - \"id\": Checks all of\
        \ the identity documents, but not necessarily the entity itself independently.\
        \ Use this in conjunction with a one_plus or two_plus for more.\n  - \"visa\"\
        :\n  \nID Validate - One of:\n  - \"idvalidate\": Checks to see if photo ID\
        \ has had OCR scanning, ID document validation and photo comparison run against\
        \ it. Can be used in conjunction with any of the KYC/ID/AML checks.\n  \n\
        Manual Check:\n  - \"manual\": (mKYC) Checks user has a sufficient amount\
        \ of operator verified ID and will then \"pass\" all Entity and ID related\
        \ checks.\n  \nFraud Checks - One or more of:\n  - \"fraudlist\": Checks to\
        \ see if the identity appears on any known fraud lists. Should be run after\
        \ KYC/ID checks have passed.\n  - \"fraudcheck\": Checks external ID services\
        \ to see if details appear in fraud detection services (e.g. EmailAge or FraudNet)\n\
        \  \nPEP Checks - One of:\n  - \"pep\": Will only run PEP/Sanctions checks\
        \ (no identity verification)\n  - \"pep_media\": Will run PEP/Sanctions checks,\
        \ as well as watchlist and adverse media checks. (no identity verification)\n\
        \  \n  * NOTE: These checks will ONLY run if either the KYC/ID checks have\
        \ been run prior, or it is the only check requested.\n  \nCustom:\n  - By\
        \ arrangement with Frankie you can define your own KYC check type.\n  \n \
        \ This will allow you to set the minimum number of matches for:\n    - name\
        \ \n    - date of birth\n    - address\n    - government id\n  \n  This allows\
        \ for alternatives to the \"standard\" two_plus or one_plus (note, these can\
        \ be overridden too).\n"

        Any documents, checks, entities that are created when this field has been populated will now be tied to this CustomerID + CustomerChildID combination. Just as Customers cannot see data created by other Customers, so too a Customer's Children will not be able to see each other's data.

            https://apidocs.frankiefinancial.com/docs/working-with-addresses

    CheckEntityCheckResultObject:
      description: |
        Describes all of the checks that were carried out against an entity as part of our cascading check process. Because there are a number of steps involved in checking an entity, (including the use of past checks done by you or others), there is an overall summary check result that will tell you the final disposition of the the check you requested.

        So if you requested a 2+2+governmentID+pep/sanctions/etc (i.e. everything) then there would have been several checks done in order to meet this requirement. Some may have even failed, but eventually we got there. The summary gives the final assessment, based on all available data.

            The score ultimately ranks entities based on their riskiness and is designed to assist you in making more informed and consistent credit decisions.  The score is based between 0 and 850 index points with a higher score considered lower risk while lower scores are deemed to be riskier entities. It should be used in partnership with your internal credit procedures and policies.
            Please note that the score and recommendation should be used in partnership with your company's internal credit procedures and policies. The score should not be used as the sole reason in making a decision about the entity.

            0 = Critical (ACN deregistered or ABN cancelled)

            1 - 125 = Entity has a critical status and significant adverse information present. Trading eligibility must be considered.)

            The list of (potentially) matching documents with confidence levels.

            If you are the "owner" of the document - i.e. the same CustomerID and CustomerChildID (if relevant) - then the full details of the document will be returned, except for the contents of any attached scans.
            If you are not the owner of the document, then just the ID and confidence level is returned. You can still use this ID to retrieve any check results (see GET /document/{documentId}/checks)

        \ (there shouldn't be, but given the way this has been defined, there can\

        \ be potentially used during the verification process.\n\nThe EntityObject\
        \ can take one of two forms.\n\n  - It can be a single entityId - in which\
        \ case the details will be pulled from the database. If using an existing\
        \ document, then the entity must also own the document or the request will\

        Similar to a KVP, the flag has a key (the flag you're indicating) and an integer value.

        Values are tied to the specific flag (see table below). Generally they're true (1)/false(0) indicators.

            | flag | values | Description |
            | ------- | -------- | -------- |
            | ongoing_pep | 0, 1, 2 | 0 = no, 1 = pep/sanctions, 2 = 1+media |
            |  |  |  |
      example:
        flag: flag
        value: 0

        flag:

          description: |
            The match types that this overall count and result refer to. Currently one or more of:
            - name
            - address
            - dob
            - gender
            - gov_id
            - other_id

            These will be keys in a map whose values hold the values for the individual match types. The resultant structure would look like the following. Here dob has zero matches and is not verfied but it was check, so other than the checked flag the value object is simply empty. A completely empty object would imply that match type was not checked.

                "matchTypes": {
                  "address": {
                    "matchCount": 1,
                    "matchSources": [ "au-elec-roll" ],
                    "checked": true,
                    "verified": true
                  },
                  "dob": {
                    "checked": true
                  }
                }

            So for a one_plus KYC check there will be two EntityProfileKYCMatchResultObject records. One for 'name' and one for 'address, dob' (like the sample above).

            If you are the "owner" of the entity - i.e. the same CustomerID and CustomerChildID (if relevant) - then the full details of the entity and any owned documents will be returned, except for the contents of any attached scans.

            If you are not the owner of the entity (or linked documents), then just the ID and confidence level is returned. You can still use this ID to retrieve any check results (see GET  /entity/{entityId}/checks and GET /document/{documentId}/checks)

    enumNotificationType:
      description: |
        Indicates the type of notification being pushed.
        - "FUNCTION": A request that you previously backgrounded has completed and this is the notification that is it complete (success is another matter)
        - "RESULT": Like the FUNCTION notification, this tells you that a previously backgrounded request has completed, and that there is a set of results in the payload pointer.
        - "EVENT": There has been a stateful change in a document, entity or some other piece of data that we are holding/monitoring for you. This is an indication that you may wish to take some action.
        - "ALERT": Like the EVENT, except that the severity of the notification indicates that action is almost certainly required.

    enumScanDataRetrievalState:
      description: |
        The reason why the scanData in a response is missing.
        - "NORMAL": The scanData was retrieved and is included. If it is empty then it was never provided or was provided empty.
        - "EXCLUDED": The retrieval request was not for 'full' data, or the object has 'ScanDelete' set so the scanData is not included
        - "FAILED": The scanData could not be retrieved from the secure document store.

        The enumScanDataRetrievalState will not usually be set in a request. If a ScannedDocumentObject in a response has a 'FAILED' retrieval state then that object should not be sent back in a future possible update. It should either be omitted or the original data should be resent if it is available from another source. However it is safe to send the object in an update with the state received in a response. Any state other than 'NORMAL' (or '') will cause the blank scanData to be ignored, but other fields in the object will be updated if needed.
      enum:
      - NORMAL
      - EXCLUDED
      - FAILED
