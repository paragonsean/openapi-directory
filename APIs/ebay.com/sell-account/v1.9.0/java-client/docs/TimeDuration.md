# TimeDuration

A type used to specify a period of time using a specified time-measurement unit. Payment, return, and fulfillment business policies all use this type to specify time windows.<br/><br/>Whenever a container that uses this type is used in a request, both of these fields are required. Similarly, whenever a container that uses this type is returned in a response, both of these fields are always returned.
