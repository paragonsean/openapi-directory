/**
 * Marketing API
 * <p>The <i>Marketing API </i> offers two platforms that sellers can use to promote and advertise their products:</p> <ul><li><b>Promoted Listings</b> is an eBay ad service that lets sellers set up <i>ad campaigns </i> for the products they want to promote. eBay displays the ads in search results and in other marketing modules as <b>SPONSORED</b> listings. If an item in a Promoted Listings campaign sells, the seller is assessed a Promoted Listings fee, which is a seller-specified percentage applied to the sales price. For complete details, refer to the <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/pl-landing.html\">Promoted Listings playbook</a>.</li><li><b>Promotions Manager</b> gives sellers a way to offer discounts on specific items as a way to attract buyers to their inventory. Sellers can set up discounts (such as \"20% off\" and other types of offers) on specific items or on an entire customer order. To further attract buyers, eBay prominently displays promotion <i>teasers</i> throughout buyer flows. For complete details, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html\">Promotions Manager</a>.</li></ul>  <p><b>Marketing reports</b>, on both the Promoted Listings and Promotions Manager platforms, give sellers information that shows the effectiveness of their marketing strategies. The data gives sellers the ability to review and fine tune their marketing efforts.</p> <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Important!</b> Sellers must have an active eBay Store subscription, and they must accept the <b>Terms and Conditions</b> before they can make requests to these APIs in the Production environment. There are also site-specific listings requirements and restrictions associated with these marketing tools, as listed in the \"requirements and restrictions\" sections for <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PL-requirements\">Promoted Listings</a> and <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\">Promotions Manager</a>.</p> <p>The table below lists all the Marketing API calls grouped by resource.</p>

/**
 * The user-defined <b>bid percentage</b> (also known as the <i>ad rate</i>) sets the level that eBay increases the visibility in search results for the associated listing. The higher the <b>bidPercentage</b> value, the more eBay promotes the listing.  <br><br>The value specified here is also used to calculate the Promoted Listings fee. This percentage value is multiplied by the final sales price to determine the fee. <br><br>The Promoted Listings fee is determined at the time the transaction completes and the seller is assessed the fee only when an item sells through a Promoted Listings ad campaign. <br><br>The <b>bidPercentage</b> is a single precision value that is guided by the following rules: <ul><li>These values are <b>valid</b>:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>4.1</code>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>5.0</code>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>5.5</code>, ...</li>  <li>These values are <b>not valid</b>:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>0.01</code>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>10.75</code>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>99.99</code>,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so on.</li></ul>This is default bid percentage for the campaigns using the Cost Per Sale (CPS) funding model, and this value will be overridden by any ads in the campaign that have their own set bid percentages.<br /><br />If a bid percentage is not provided for an ad, eBay uses the default bid percentage of the associated campaign.<br /><br /><b>Minimum value:</b> 2.0 <br><b>Maximum value:</b> 100.0
