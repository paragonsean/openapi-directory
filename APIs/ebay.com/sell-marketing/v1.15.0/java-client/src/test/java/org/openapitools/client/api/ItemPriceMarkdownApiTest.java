/*
 * Marketing API
 * <p>The <i>Marketing API </i> offers two platforms that sellers can use to promote and advertise their products:</p> <ul><li><b>Promoted Listings</b> is an eBay ad service that lets sellers set up <i>ad campaigns </i> for the products they want to promote. eBay displays the ads in search results and in other marketing modules as <b>SPONSORED</b> listings. If an item in a Promoted Listings campaign sells, the seller is assessed a Promoted Listings fee, which is a seller-specified percentage applied to the sales price. For complete details, refer to the <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/pl-landing.html\">Promoted Listings playbook</a>.</li><li><b>Promotions Manager</b> gives sellers a way to offer discounts on specific items as a way to attract buyers to their inventory. Sellers can set up discounts (such as \"20% off\" and other types of offers) on specific items or on an entire customer order. To further attract buyers, eBay prominently displays promotion <i>teasers</i> throughout buyer flows. For complete details, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html\">Promotions Manager</a>.</li></ul>  <p><b>Marketing reports</b>, on both the Promoted Listings and Promotions Manager platforms, give sellers information that shows the effectiveness of their marketing strategies. The data gives sellers the ability to review and fine tune their marketing efforts.</p> <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Important!</b> Sellers must have an active eBay Store subscription, and they must accept the <b>Terms and Conditions</b> before they can make requests to these APIs in the Production environment. There are also site-specific listings requirements and restrictions associated with these marketing tools, as listed in the \"requirements and restrictions\" sections for <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PL-requirements\">Promoted Listings</a> and <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\">Promotions Manager</a>.</p> <p>The table below lists all the Marketing API calls grouped by resource.</p>

    /**
     * This method creates an &lt;b&gt;item price markdown promotion&lt;/b&gt; (know simply as a \&quot;markdown promotion\&quot;) where a discount amount is applied directly to the items included the promotion. Discounts can be specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price. eBay highlights promoted items by placing teasers for the items throughout the online sales flows.  &lt;p&gt;Unlike an &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/api-docs/sell/marketing/resources/item_promotion/methods/createItemPromotion\&quot;&gt;item promotion&lt;/a&gt;, a markdown promotion does not require the buyer meet a \&quot;threshold\&quot; before the offer takes effect. With markdown promotions, all the buyer needs to do is purchase the item to receive the promotion benefit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class&#x3D;\&quot;tablenote\&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; There are some restrictions for which listings are available for price markdown promotions. For details, see &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\&quot;&gt;Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, we recommend you list items at competitive prices before including them in your markdown promotions. For an extensive list of pricing recommendations, see the &lt;b&gt;Growth&lt;/b&gt; tab in Seller Hub.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are two ways to add items to markdown promotions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key-based promotions&lt;/b&gt; select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the &lt;b&gt;inventoryReferenceId&lt;/b&gt; and the associated &lt;b&gt;inventoryReferenceType&lt;/b&gt; of the item(s) you want to include the promotion.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rule-based promotions&lt;/b&gt; select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items in a promotion by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;New promotions must be created in either a &lt;code&gt;DRAFT&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;SCHEDULED&lt;/code&gt; state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a promotion and you want to be sure it&#39;s correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a promotion, the promotion ID is returned in the &lt;b&gt;Location&lt;/b&gt; response header. Use this ID to reference the promotion in subsequent requests (such as to schedule a promotion that&#39;s in a DRAFT state).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class&#x3D;\&quot;tablenote\&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Refer to &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html\&quot;&gt;Promotions Manager&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Selling Integration Guide&lt;/i&gt; for details and examples showing how to create and manage seller promotions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Markdown promotions are available on all eBay marketplaces. For more information, see &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\&quot;&gt;Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
