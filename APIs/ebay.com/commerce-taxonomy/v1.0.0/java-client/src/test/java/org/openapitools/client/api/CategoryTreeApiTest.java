/*
 * Taxonomy API
 * Use the Taxonomy API to discover the most appropriate eBay categories under which sellers can offer inventory items for sale, and the most likely categories under which buyers can browse or search for items to purchase. In addition, the Taxonomy API provides metadata about the required and recommended category aspects to include in listings, and also has two operations to retrieve parts compatibility information.

     * Note: The General Availability (GA) version of the Taxonomy API has been released. Developers currently using the Beta version should make plans to migrate to the new GA version, as the Beta version will be decommissioned on March 31, 2021. Until that date, the Beta version documentation set can be accessed through the All API Documentation page. This call returns a complete list of aspects for all of the leaf categories that belong to an eBay marketplace. The eBay marketplace is specified through the category_tree_id URI parameter. Note: This call can return a large payload, so the call returns the response as a gzipped JSON file. The open source Taxonomy SDK can be used to compare the aspect metadata that is returned in this response. The bulk download capability that this method provides, when combined with the Taxonomy SDK, brings transparency to the evolution of the metadata.
