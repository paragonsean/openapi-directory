|**aspectDataType** | **String** | The data type of this aspect. For implementation help, refer to &lt;a href&#x3D;&#39;https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/commerce/taxonomy/types/txn:AspectDataTypeEnum&#39;&gt;eBay API documentation&lt;/a&gt; |  [optional] |
|**aspectEnabledForVariations** | **Boolean** | A value of true indicates that this aspect can be used to help identify item variations. |  [optional] |
|**aspectFormat** | **String** | Returned only if the value of aspectDataType identifies a data type that requires specific formatting. Currently, this field provides formatting hints as follows: DATE: YYYY, YYYYMM, YYYYMMDD NUMBER: int32, double |  [optional] |
|**aspectMaxLength** | **Integer** | The maximum length of the item/instance aspect&#39;s value. The seller must make sure not to exceed this length when specifying the instance aspect&#39;s value for a product. This field is only returned for instance aspects. |  [optional] |
|**aspectMode** | **String** | The manner in which values of this aspect must be specified by the seller (as free text or by selecting from available options).
