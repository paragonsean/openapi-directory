    /**
     * This method returns a report that details the user traffic received by a seller&#39;s listings. A traffic report gives sellers the ability to review how often their listings appeared on eBay, how many times their listings are viewed, and how many purchases were made. The report also returns the report&#39;s start and end dates, and the date the information was last updated. When using this call: Be sure to URL-encode the values you pass in query parameters, as described in URI parameters. See the request samples below for details. You can only specify a single metric in the sort parameter and the specified metric must be listed in the metric parameter of your request. Parameter names are case sensitive, but metric names are not. For example, the following are correct: sort&#x3D;LISTING_IMPRESSION_TOTAL sort&#x3D;lisitng_impression_total metric&#x3D;lisitng_impression_total However, these are incorrect: SORT&#x3D;LISTING_IMPRESSION_TOTAL SORT&#x3D;lisitng_impression_total Metric&#x3D;lisitng_impression_total For more information, see Traffic report details.
