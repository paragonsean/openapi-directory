# TaxIdentifier

This type is used by the <strong>taxIdentifier</strong> container that is returned in <strong>getOrder</strong>. The <strong>taxIdentifier</strong> container consists of taxpayer identification information for buyers from Italy, Spain, or Guatemala. It is currently only returned for orders occurring on the eBay Italy or eBay Spain marketplaces.<br><br><span class=\"tablenote\"><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, the <strong>taxIdentifier</strong> container is only returned in <strong>getOrder</strong> and not in <strong>getOrders</strong>. So, if a seller wanted to view a buyer's tax information for a particular order returned in <strong>getOrders</strong>, that seller would need to use the <strong>orderId</strong> value for that particular order, and then run a <strong>getOrder</strong> call against that order ID. </span>
