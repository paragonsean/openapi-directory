/*
 * Analytics API
 * The <b>Analytics API</b> retrieves call-limit data and the quotas that are set for the RESTful APIs and the legacy Trading API.  <br><br>Responses from calls made to <b>getRateLimits</b> and <b>getUerRateLimits</b> include a list of the applicable resources and the \"call limit\", or quota, that is set for each resource. In addition to quota information, the response also includes the number of remaining calls available before the limit is reached, the time remaining before the quota resets, and the length of the \"time window\" to which the quota applies.  <br><br>The <b>getRateLimits</b> and <b>getUserRateLimits</b> methods retrieve call-limit information for either an application or user, respectively, and each method must be called with an appropriate OAuth token. That is, <b>getRateLimites</b> requires an access token generated with a client credentials grant and <b>getUserRateLimites</b> requires an access token generated with an authorization code grant. For more information, see <a href=\"/api-docs/static/oauth-tokens.html\">OAuth tokens</a>.  <br><br>Users can analyze the response data to see whether or not a limit might be reached, and from that determine if any action needs to be taken (such as programmatically throttling their request rate). For more on call limits, see <a href=\"https://developer.ebay.com/support/app-check \" target=\"_blank\">Compatible Application Check</a>.

     * This method retrieves the call limit and utilization data for an application user. The call-limit data is returned for all RESTful APIs and the legacy Trading API that limit calls on a per-user basis.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The response from &lt;b&gt;getUserRateLimits&lt;/b&gt; includes a list of the applicable resources and the \&quot;call limit\&quot;, or quota, that is set for each resource. In addition to quota information, the response also includes the number of remaining calls available before the limit is reached, the time remaining before the quota resets, and the length of the \&quot;time window\&quot; to which the quota applies.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By default, this method returns utilization data for all RESTful APIs resources and the legacy Trading API calls that limit request access by user. Use the &lt;b&gt;api_name&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;api_context&lt;/b&gt; query parameters to filter the response to only the desired APIs.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more on call limits, see &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://developer.ebay.com/support/app-check \&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Compatible Application Check&lt;/a&gt;.
