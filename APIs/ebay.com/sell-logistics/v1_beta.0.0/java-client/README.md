<span class=\"tablenote\"><b>Note:</b> This is a <a href=\"https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/versioning.html#limited\" target=\"_blank\"> <img src=\"/cms/img/docs/partners-api.svg\" class=\"legend-icon partners-icon\" title=\"Limited Release\"  alt=\"Limited Release\" />(Limited Release)</a> API available only to select developers approved by business units.</span><br /><br />The <b>Logistics API</b> resources offer the following capabilities: <ul><li><b>shipping_quote</b> &ndash; Consolidates into a list a set of live shipping rates, or quotes, from which you can select a rate to ship a package.</li> <li><b>shipment</b> &ndash; Creates a \"shipment\" for the selected shipping rate.</li></ul> Call <b>createShippingQuote</b> to get a list of live shipping rates. The rates returned are all valid for a specific time window and all quoted prices are at eBay-negotiated rates. <br><br>Select one of the live rates and using its associated <b>rateId</b>, create a \"shipment\" for the package by calling <b>createFromShippingQuote</b>. Creating a shipment completes an agreement, and the cost of the base service and any added shipping options are summed into the returned <b>totalShippingCost</b> value. This action also generates a shipping label that you can use to ship the package.  The total cost of the shipment is incurred when the package is shipped using the supplied shipping label.  <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Important!</b> Sellers must set up a payment method via their eBay account before they can use the methods in this API to create a shipment and the associated shipping label.</p>

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:
1. Java 1.8+
2. Maven (3.8.3+)/Gradle (7.2+)

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

### Maven users

Add this dependency to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId>
  <artifactId>openapi-java-client</artifactId>
  <version>v1_beta.0.0</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()     // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to maven central.
    mavenLocal()       // Needed if the 'openapi-java-client' jar has been published to the local maven repo.
  }

  dependencies {
     implementation "org.openapitools:openapi-java-client:v1_beta.0.0"
  }
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

* `target/openapi-java-client-v1_beta.0.0.jar`
* `target/lib/*.jar`

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

// Import classes:
import org.openapitools.client.ApiClient;
import org.openapitools.client.ApiException;
import org.openapitools.client.Configuration;
import org.openapitools.client.auth.*;
import org.openapitools.client.model.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.ShipmentApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://api.ebay.com/sell/logistics/v1_beta");
    
    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: api_auth
    OAuth api_auth = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("api_auth");
    api_auth.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    ShipmentApi apiInstance = new ShipmentApi(defaultClient);
    String shipmentId = "shipmentId_example"; // String | This path parameter specifies the unique eBay-assigned ID of the shipment to be canceled. The <b>shipmentId</b> value is generated and returned by a call to <b>createFromShippingQuote</b>.
    try {
      Shipment result = apiInstance.cancelShipment(shipmentId);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling ShipmentApi#cancelShipment");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

```
