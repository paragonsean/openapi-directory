Logistics API

- Generator version: 7.9.0

<span class=\"tablenote\"><b>Note:</b> This is a <a href=\"https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/versioning.html#limited\" target=\"_blank\"> <img src=\"/cms/img/docs/partners-api.svg\" class=\"legend-icon partners-icon\" title=\"Limited Release\"  alt=\"Limited Release\" />(Limited Release)</a> API available only to select developers approved by business units.</span><br /><br />The <b>Logistics API</b> resources offer the following capabilities: <ul><li><b>shipping_quote</b> &ndash; Consolidates into a list a set of live shipping rates, or quotes, from which you can select a rate to ship a package.</li> <li><b>shipment</b> &ndash; Creates a \"shipment\" for the selected shipping rate.</li></ul> Call <b>createShippingQuote</b> to get a list of live shipping rates. The rates returned are all valid for a specific time window and all quoted prices are at eBay-negotiated rates. <br><br>Select one of the live rates and using its associated <b>rateId</b>, create a \"shipment\" for the package by calling <b>createFromShippingQuote</b>. Creating a shipment completes an agreement, and the cost of the base service and any added shipping options are summed into the returned <b>totalShippingCost</b> value. This action also generates a shipping label that you can use to ship the package.  The total cost of the shipment is incurred when the package is shipped using the supplied shipping label.  <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Important!</b> Sellers must set up a payment method via their eBay account before they can use the methods in this API to create a shipment and the associated shipping label.</p>

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:

1. CMake 3.2+
2. Qt
3. C++ Compiler

## Getting Started

example.h:
```c++

#include <iostream>
#include "../client/OAIShipmentApi.h"

using namespace test_namespace;

class Example : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT
    QString create();
public Q_SLOTS:
   void exampleFunction1();
};

```

example.cpp:
```c++

#include "../client/OAIShipmentApi.h"
#include "example.h"
#include <QTimer>
#include <QEventLoop>

QString Example::create(){
    QString obj;
 return obj;
}

void Example::exampleFunction1(){
     OAIShipmentApi apiInstance;
     
      //OAuth Authentication supported right now

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIShipmentApi::cancelShipmentSignal, [&]() {
          loop.quit();
      });
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIShipmentApi::cancelShipmentSignalE, [&](QNetworkReply::NetworkError, QString error_str) {
          qDebug() << "Error happened while issuing request : " << error_str;
          loop.quit();
      });

      QString shipment_id = create(); // QString | This path parameter specifies the unique eBay-assigned ID of the shipment to be canceled. The <b>shipmentId</b> value is generated and returned by a call to <b>createFromShippingQuote</b>.
      apiInstance.cancelShipment(shipment_id);
      QTimer::singleShot(5000, &loop, &QEventLoop::quit);
      loop.exec();
  }

```

## Documentation for Servers

Parameterized Servers are supported. Define a server in the API for each endpoint with arbitrary numbers of variables:

```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:{port}/{basePath}
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
    port:
      enum:
        - '3000'
        - '1000'
      default: '3000'
    basePath:
      default: v1
```
To change the default variable, use this function in each Api:
```c++
int setDefaultServerValue(int serverIndex,const QString &operation, const QString &variable,const QString &val);
```
The parameter "serverIndex" will choose a server from the server list for each endpoint. There is always at least one server with index 0. The Parameter "operation" should be the desired endpoint operationid.
Variable is the name of the variable you wish to change and the value is the new default Value.
The function will return -1 when the variable does not exists, -2 if value is not defined in the variable enum and -3 if the operation is not found.

If your endpoint has multiple server objects in the servers array, you can set the server that will be used with this function:
```c++
void setServerIndex(const QString &operation, int serverIndex);
```
Parameter "operation" should be your operationid. "serverIndex" is the index you want to set as your default server. The function will check if there is a server with your index.
Here is an example of multiple servers in the servers array. The first server will have index 0 and the second will have index 1.
```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:8080/
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
- url: https://localhost:8080/v1
```

## Documentation for Authorization

Authentication schemes defined for the API:
### api_auth


- **Type**: OAuth
- **Flow**: accessCode
- **Authorization URL**: https://auth.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize
- **Scopes**: 
  - https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.logistics:  This scope would allow signed in user to access Logistics information.
