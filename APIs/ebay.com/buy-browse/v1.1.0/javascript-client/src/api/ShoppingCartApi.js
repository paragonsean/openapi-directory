/**
 * Browse API
 * The Browse API has the following resources: item_summary: Lets shoppers search for specific items by keyword, GTIN, category, charity, product, or item aspects and refine the results by using filters, such as aspects, compatibility, and fields values. &nbsp;(Experimental) search_by_image: Lets shoppers search for specific items by image. You can refine the results by using URI parameters and filters. item: Lets you retrieve the details of a specific item or all the items in an item group, which is an item with variations such as color and size and check if a product is compatible with the specified item, such as if a specific car is compatible with a specific part. Provides a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as Finding, and the RESTful APIs, which use different formats for the item IDs. &nbsp;(Experimental) shopping_cart: Provides the ability for eBay members to see the contents of their eBay cart, and add, remove, and change the quantity of items in their eBay cart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: This resource is not available in the eBay API Explorer. The item_summary, search_by_image, and item resource calls require an Application access token. The shopping_cart resource calls require a User access token.

     * This is an Experimental method. This method creates an eBay cart for the eBay member, if one does not exist, and adds items to that cart. Because a cart never expires, any item added to the cart will remain in the cart until it is removed. To use this method, you must submit a RESTful item ID and the quantity of the item. If the quantity value is greater than the number of available, the quantity value is changed to the number available and a warning is returned. For example, if there are 15 baseballs available and you set the quantity value to 50, the service automatically changes the value of quantity to 15. The response returns all the items in the eBay member's cart; items added to the cart while on ebay.com as well as items added to the cart using the Browse API. The quantity and state of an item changes often. If the item becomes &quot;unavailable&quot; such as, when the listing has ended or the item is out of stock, whether it has just been added to the cart or has been in the cart for some time, the item will be returned in the unavailableCartItems container. Note: There are differences between how legacy APIs, such as Finding, and RESTful APIs, such as Browse, return the identifier of an &quot;item&quot; and what the item ID represents. If you have an item ID from one of the legacy APIs, you can use the legacy item ID with the getItemByLegacyId method to retrieve the RESTful ID for that item. For more information about how to use legacy IDs with the Buy APIs, see Legacy API compatibility in the Buying Integration guide.

Restrictions This method can be used only for eBay members. You can add only items with a FIXED_PRICE that accept PayPal as a payment.
