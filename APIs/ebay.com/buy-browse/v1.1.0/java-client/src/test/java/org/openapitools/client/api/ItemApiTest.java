/*
 * Browse API
 * The Browse API has the following resources: item_summary: Lets shoppers search for specific items by keyword, GTIN, category, charity, product, or item aspects and refine the results by using filters, such as aspects, compatibility, and fields values. &nbsp;(Experimental) search_by_image: Lets shoppers search for specific items by image. You can refine the results by using URI parameters and filters. item: Lets you retrieve the details of a specific item or all the items in an item group, which is an item with variations such as color and size and check if a product is compatible with the specified item, such as if a specific car is compatible with a specific part. Provides a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as Finding, and the RESTful APIs, which use different formats for the item IDs. &nbsp;(Experimental) shopping_cart: Provides the ability for eBay members to see the contents of their eBay cart, and add, remove, and change the quantity of items in their eBay cart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: This resource is not available in the eBay API Explorer. The item_summary, search_by_image, and item resource calls require an Application access token. The shopping_cart resource calls require a User access token.

     * This method checks if a product is compatible with the specified item. You can use this method to check the compatibility of cars, trucks, and motorcycles with a specific part listed on eBay. For example, to check the compatibility of a part, you pass in the item ID of the part as a URI parameter and specify all the attributes used to define a specific car in the compatibilityProperties container. If the call is successful, the response will be COMPATIBLE, NOT_COMPATIBLE, or UNDETERMINED. See compatibilityStatus for details. Note: The only products supported are cars, trucks, and motorcycles. To find the attributes and values for a specific marketplace, you can use the compatibility methods in the Taxonomy API. You can use this data to create menus to help buyers specify the product, such as their car. For more details and a list of the required attributes for the US marketplace that describe motor vehicles, see Check compatibility in the Buy Integration Guide. For an example, see the Samples section. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item/ Note: This method is supported only on Production.

     * This method retrieves the details of a specific item, such as description, price, category, all item aspects, condition, return policies, seller feedback and score, shipping options, shipping costs, estimated delivery, and other information the buyer needs to make a purchasing decision. The Buy APIs are designed to let you create an eBay shopping experience in your app or website. This means you will need to know when something, such as the availability, quantity, etc., has changed in any eBay item you are offering. You can do this easily by setting the fieldgroups URI parameter. This parameter lets you control what is returned in the response. Setting fieldgroups to COMPACT reduces the response to only the five fields that you need in order to check if any item detail has changed. Setting fieldgroups to PRODUCT, adds additional fields to the default response that return information about the product of the item. You can use either COMPACT or PRODUCT but not both. For more information, see fieldgroups.

     * This method is a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as Shopping, and Finding and the eBay Buy APIs. There are differences between how legacy APIs and RESTful APIs return the identifier of an &amp;quot;item&amp;quot; and what the item ID represents. This method lets you use the legacy item ids retrieve the details of a specific item, such as description, price, and other information the buyer needs to make a purchasing decision. It also returns the RESTful item ID, which you can use with all the Buy API methods. For more information about how to use legacy ids with the Buy APIs, see Legacy API compatibility in the Buying Integration guide. This method returns the item details and requires you to pass in either the item ID of a non-variation item or the item ids of both the parent and child of an item group. An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. When an item group is created, one of the item variations, such as the red shirt size L, is chosen as the &amp;quot;parent&amp;quot;. All the other items in the group are the children, such as the blue shirt size L, red shirt size M, etc. The fieldgroups URI parameter lets you control what is returned in the response. Setting fieldgroups to PRODUCT, adds additional fields to the default response that return information about the product of the item. For more information, see fieldgroups.

The items container has an array of containers with the details of each item in the group. The commonDescriptions container has an array of containers for a description and the item ids of all the items that have this exact description.
