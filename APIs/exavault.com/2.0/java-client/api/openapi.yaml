      description: "Creates a new share object for the given path in your account.\
        \ We support three types of shares:\n\n  - A **shared folder** allows you\
        \ to let outside parties access a folder in your account (including any files\
        \ and nested subfolders) using just a link. Shared folders can be restricted;\
        \ e.g. with an expiration date, password, download-only, etc. Shared folders\
        \ are 'live'; if someone makes a change to a file in your shared folder, it\
        \ will be immediately reflected in your account, and vice-versa.\n  - A file\
        \ **send** lets you send one or more files via an easy download link. File\
        \ sends are different than shared folders because file sends are 'point in\
        \ time' -- the recipient will get the files as you sent them. If you later\
        \ make a change to the source file, it will not be updated for the recipient.\n\
        \  - A **receive** folder lets you receive files into your account. You can\
        \ either send users a link, or optionally [embed a customized form](/docs/account/05-file-sharing/05-upload-widget)\
        \ on your website.\n  \n**How to send files from your computer using the API**:\n\
        \nIn order to use the API to send files which are not already stored in your\
        \ account, you'll need to follow a three-step process:\n\n1. Use the [POST\
        \ /shares](#operation/addShare) endpoint to set up your send, including password,\
        \ recipients, expiration, etc. You must include **upload** among the permissions\
        \ in the `accessMode` and set the `sendingLocalFiles` parameter to **true**.\
        \ The response that is returned will include a \"meta\" attribute, which contains\
        \ an **accessToken** attribute. This new access token is valid only for the\
        \ send.\n2. Use the [POST /resources/upload](#operation/uploadFile) endpoint\
        \ to upload your files to the send you've created. The \"/\" path represents\
        \ the root of the share, not your home directory. **You must send the access\
        \ token that you received from the first step in the `ev-access-token` header**\n\
        3. Use the [POST /shares/complete-send/{id}](#operation/completeDirectSend)\
        \ endpoint to indicate that you have finished uploading files to your send.\
        \ This will trigger the system to remove the **upload** permission from the\
        \ share and send any invitation emails you set up in the first step of the\
        \ process. **You must send YOUR access token in the `ev-access-token` header,\
        \ not the temporary access token**\n\n**Setting the Share Permissions**\n\n\
        Only 5 different combinations of permissions are valid for the `accessMode`\
        \ object:\n\n- **Upload Only**: This allows share visitors to upload to a\
        \ share but do nothing else to the contained files. To use this mode, set\
        \ `upload` to **true** and all other permissions to **false**\n- **Download\
        \ Only**: This allows share visitors to download files from a share but do\
        \ nothing else to the contained files. To use this mode, set `download` to\
        \ **true** and all other permissions to **false**\n- **Upload and Download**:\
        \ This allows share visitors to upload new files to the share or download\
        \ files within the share, but not make any other changes to the share contents.\
        \ To use this mode, set `upload` and `download` to **true** and set both `modify`\
        \ and `delete` to **false**\n- **All but Delete**: This allows share visitors\
        \ to make any changes to the contents of a share except deleting files. To\
        \ use this mode, set `upload`, `download`, and `modify` to **true** and set\
        \ `delete` to **false**\n- **Full Access**: This allows share visitors to\
        \ make any changes to the contents of a share. To use this mode, set all 4\
        \ permissions `upload`, `download`, `modify`, and `delete` to **true**\n\n\
        Any other combination of permissions provided as the `accessMode` will be\
        \ rejected as a bad request.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nAuthenticated user requires\
        \ [share permission](/docs/account/04-users/00-introduction#managing-user-roles-and-permissions)."

        \ \n**How to send files from your computer using the API**:\n\nIn order to\
        \ use the API to send files which are not already stored in your account,\
        \ you'll need to follow a three-step process:\n\n1. Use the [POST /shares](#operation/addShare)\
        \ endpoint to set up your send, including password, recipients, expiration,\
        \ etc. You must include **upload** among the permissions in the `accessMode`\
        \ and set the `sendingLocalFiles` paramter to **true**. The response that\
        \ is returned will include a \"meta\" attribute, which contains an **accessToken**\
        \ attribute. This new access token is valid only for the send.\n2. Use the\
        \ [POST /resources/upload](#operation/uploadFile) endpoint to upload your\
        \ files to the send you've created. The \"/\" path represents the root of\
        \ the share, not your home directory. **You must send the access token that\
        \ you received from the first step in the `ev-access-token` header**\n3. Use\
        \ the [POST /shares/complete-send/{id}](#operation/completeDirectSend) endpoint\
        \ to indicate that you have finished uploading files to your send. This will\
        \ trigger the system to remove the **upload** permission from the share and\
        \ send any invitation emails you set up in the first step of the process.\
        \ **You must send YOUR access token in the `ev-access-token` header, not the\
        \ temporary access token**\n"

        Deactivate a share. Deactivating a share does not remove the underlying files for **shared_folder** and **receive** share types; it merely removes the access URL. Deleting a **send** share type does remove the associated files, as files that have been sent are only associated with the share, and aren't stored anywhere else in the account.

        - You must have [sharing permissons](/docs/account/04-users/00-introduction#managing-user-roles-and-permissions) to use this.

        Updates the settings for the user. Note that the unique key for this API call is our internal ID, and _not_ the username, as the username can be changed.

        In the request body, you should only send the parameters for values that you wish to change for the user.

        **Notes:**

        - You must have [admin or master](/docs/account/04-users/00-introduction#managing-user-roles-and-permissions) access to edit other users. If you have user-level access, you can only update your own user settings.
        - You cannot edit a master user with this method.
