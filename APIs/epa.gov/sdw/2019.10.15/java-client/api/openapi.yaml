  description: "Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed\
    \ and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public\
    \ use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over\
    \ 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.\n   SDW Rest Services provides multiple\
    \ service endpoints, each with specific capabilities, to search and retrieve data\
    \ on public water systems regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).\
    \  The returned results reflect data drawn from EPA's Federal Safe Drinking Water\
    \ Information System (SDWIS) database.\n\\\nThe get_systems, get_qid, and get_download\
    \ end points are meant to be used together.\n\\\nThe recommended use scenario\
    \ for get_systems, get_qid, and get_downoad is:\n\\\n <b>1)</b>  Use get_systems\
    \ to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain\
    \ a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately\
    \ 30 minutes.\n <b>2)</b>  Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through\
    \ arrays of water system results.\n <b>3)</b>  Use get_download, with the returned\
    \ QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of water system information\
    \ that meets the QID query criteria.\n\\\n\\\nUse the qcolumns parameter to customize\
    \ your search results.  Use the Metadata service endpoint for a list of available\
    \ output objects, their Column Ids, and their definitions to help you build your\
    \ customized output. \n\\\nAdditional ECHO Resources:   <a href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/web-services\"\
