  description: "Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed\
    \ and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public\
    \ use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over\
    \ 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.\n   RCRA Rest Services provides multiple\
    \ service endpoints, each with specific capabilities, to search and retrieve data\
    \ on hazardous waste handlers/facilities regulated under the Resource Conservation\
    \ and Recovery Act (RCRA).   The returned results reflect data drawn from EPA's\
    \ RCRAInfo database.\n\\\nThe get_facilities, get_map, get_qid, and get_download\
    \ end points are meant to be used together, while the enhanced get_facility_info\
    \ end point is self contained.\n  The get_facility_info end point returns either\
    \ an array of state, county or zip clusters with summary statistics per cluster\
    \ or an array of facilities.\n\\\nThe recommended use scenario for get_facilities,\
    \ get_qid, get_map, and get_downoad is:\n\\\n <b>1)</b>  Use get_facilities to\
    \ validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a\
    \ query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately\
    \ 30 minutes.\n <b>2)</b>  Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through\
    \ arrays of facility results.\n <b>3)</b>  Use get_map, with the returned QID,\
    \ to zoom in/out and pan on the clustered and individual facility coordinates\
    \ that meet the QID query criteria.\n <b>4)</b>  Use get_download, with the returned\
    \ QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of facility information\
    \ that meets the QID query criteria.\n\\\n\\\nUse the qcolumns parameter to customize\
    \ your search results.  Use the Metadata service endpoint for a list of available\
    \ output objects, their Column Ids, and their definitions to help you build your\
    \ customized output. \n\\\nAdditional ECHO Resources:   <a href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/web-services\"\
