|**attainsAquaticLifeUseFlg** | **String** | Displays \&quot;Y\&quot; if the waterbody in which the facility resides is designated for aquatic life use. The data are from the ATTAINS database. |  |
|**attainsAuCategory** | **String** | The impairment class or category of the waterbody in which the facility is permitted to discharge directly. The data are from the ATTAINS database: - 5  &#x3D; Impaired: TMDL needed. Available information indicates that at least one designated use is not being supported and a TMDL is needed (also known as the 303(d) listed waters). - 4  &#x3D; Impaired: TMDL not needed. Available information indicates that at least one designated use is not being supported, but a TMDL is not needed (see subcategories). - 4a &#x3D; TMDL completed. A TMDL has been completed, but impairment still exists. - 4b &#x3D; TMDL alternative. Impairment is being addressed by a method other than a TMDL (e.g., stream bank improvements). - 4c &#x3D; Non-pollutant causes. Cause of impairment is not a pollutant (e.g., habitat destruction). |  |
|**attainsCauseGroups** | **String** | Lists all groups of pollutants or stressors that are causing impairment in the assessed waterbody. The data are from the ATTAINS database. |  |
|**attainsExceptnlUseFlg** | **String** | Displays \&quot;Y\&quot; if the waterbody in which the facility resides is designated for exceptional use. The data are from the ATTAINS database. |  |

|**cwPCsoOutfalls** | **String** | The number of discharge outfalls at points prior to the treatment plant. |  |
|**epASystem** | **String** | The EPA data system in which permit and facility records are kept. EPA&#39;s Facility Registry System (FRS) links all program database records (such as permit IDs and IDs facilities use in reporting to EPA) together. The following list describes the individual data systems that are linked to from the detailed facility report:   - AFS: Air Facility System for Clean Air Act stationary source programs. - ICP: Integrated Compliance Information System for Clean Water Act programs monitoring National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. - RCR: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRAInfo) for tracking the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs. - NCDB: National Compliance Database System for monitoring national performance of the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 (EPCRA); the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response (AHERA); and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). - TRI: Toxics Release Inventory for Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 submissions. - NEI: National Emissions Inventory database contains information on stationary and mobile sources that emit criteria air pollutants and their precursors, as well as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The database includes estimates of annual emissions, by source, of air pollutants in each area of the country, on an annual basis. - TSCA: Toxic Substances Control Act addressing the production, importation, use, and disposal of specific chemicals. |  |
|**esaAquaticSpeciesFlg** | **String** | Indicates if the watershed contains Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed aquatic species. |  |
|**HUC8** | **String** | The 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) of the watershed in which the facility resides.ï¿½Cataloguing unit (fourth-level, 8-digit HUC) |  |
|**huC8Name** | **String** | The name of the watershed in which the facility resides. |  |
|**impairedWaters** | **String** | Field indicates if the permit discharges directly into category 4 or 5 impaired waters. |  |
