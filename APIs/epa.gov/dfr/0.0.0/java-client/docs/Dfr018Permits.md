|**universe** | **String** | This field provides further description on type of permit or record for each data system as follows: - For CAA  &#x3D; The program office defines each CAA Source ID and the associated permits as being Federally Reportable or Non-Federally Reportable. Under the CAA, federally reportable sources include majors, synthetic minors, NESHAP Part 61 minors, minors with an unresolved High Priority Violation (HPV), with recent enforcement actions, or included on a Compliance Monitoring Strategy plan. The Clean Air Act requires that delegated agencies and EPA track all federally reportable sources in Air Facility System (AFS). - For CWA  &#x3D; Each CWA Source ID or National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is defined by the program office as a Major or Minor discharger. - For RCRA &#x3D; RCRA Source ID or permits for Treatment, Storage and Disposal facilities are identified by TSD, Large Quantity Generators are identified by LQG.
