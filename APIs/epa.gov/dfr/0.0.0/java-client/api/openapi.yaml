  description: "Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed\
    \ and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public\
    \ use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over\
    \ 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.\n\nDFR Rest Services provide multiple\
    \ service endpoints, to retrieve detailed facility location, enforcement, compliance\
    \ monitoring, and pollutant information for any single facility.  See the Detailed\
    \ Facility Report (DFR) Help Page (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/detailed-facility-report-help)\
    \ for additional information on the DFR.  Additionally, a Data Dictionary (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/dfr-data-dictionary)\
    \ is also available. \nThere is one primary service end point, get_dfr, that provides\
    \ all available DFR data.  All other service end points that are exposed, will\
    \ return data on a single section of the DFR.    \n\\\nAdditional ECHO Resources:\

Under the CWA, all facilities discharging pollutants from a point source (e.g., a pipe) to surface waters must have a NPDES permit. For CWA, ICISNPDES designates a permit as Effective, Administratively Continued, Expired, Not Needed, Pending, Retired, or Terminated. RCRA facilities (sites) are designated as Active or Inactive.

Under the CAA, federally reportable sources include majors, synthetic minors, NESHAP Part 61 minors, minors with an unresolved High Priority Violation (HPV), with recent enforcement actions, or included on a Compliance Monitoring Strategy plan. The Clean Air Act requires that delegated agencies and EPA track all federally reportable sources in Air Facility System (AFS).
            - For CWA  = Each CWA Source ID or National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is defined by the program office as a Major or Minor discharger.
            - For RCRA = RCRA Source ID or permits for Treatment, Storage and Disposal facilities are identified by TSD, Large Quantity Generators are identified by LQG. Other values include Permit Workload (PMT), Closure Workload (CLO), Small Quantity Generator Universe (SQG), Conditionally-Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG), Post-Closure Workload (POST CL), and Transporters.

            The type of measurement used to determine the violation. Applicable values:
            - "Mnthly"  stands for monthly. This means that the exceedance shown in that row was based upon a monthly average of readings submitted by the permittee.
            - "NMth" stands for non-monthly. This is generally a "maximum" amount read during the reporting period (and could indicate a spike that is not continuous). "Neither" denotes other measurements such as a minimum (e.g., pH could be in violation if below the permitted level).

            The type of measurement used to determine the violation. Applicable values:
            - "Mnthly"  stands for monthly. This means that the exceedance shown in that row was based upon a monthly average of readings submitted by the permittee.
            - "NMth" stands for non-monthly. This is generally a "maximum" amount read during the reporting period (and could indicate a spike that is not continuous). "Neither" denotes other measurements such as a minimum (e.g., pH could be in violation if below the permitted level).

            The type of measurement used to determine the violation. Applicable values:
            - "Mnthly"  stands for monthly. This means that the exceedance shown in that row was based upon a monthly average of readings submitted by the permittee.
            - "NMth" stands for non-monthly. This is generally a "maximum" amount read during the reporting period (and could indicate a spike that is not continuous). "Neither" denotes other measurements such as a minimum (e.g., pH could be in violation if below the permitted level).

For EPA civil cases, these numbers begin with either the two digit EPA Region Code, "HQ" (headquarters initiated cases), and "EF" or "WF" (Eastern or Western Field Office CAA Mobile Source Program cases); followed by the fiscal year in which the action was initiated. After the fiscal year there is a sequence number. State NPDES civil cases start with the two character post abbreviation, followed by a sequence number.
            For criminal cases, the ID was generated in ECHO based on the following format: CR [prosecution_summary_id]. The source of the Prosecution Summary ID is the Summary of Criminal Prosecutions database.

            Describes the status of the drinking water violation. Violation statuses include:
            - Resolved: The violation has at least one resolving enforcement action. In SDWIS, this indicates that either the system has returned to compliance from the violation, the rule that was violated was no longer applicable, or no further action was needed.
            - Archived: The violation is not Resolved, but is more than five years past its compliance period end date. In keeping with the Enforcement Response Policy, the violation no longer contributes to the public water system's overall compliance status. Unresolved violations are also marked as Archived when a system ceases operations (becomes inactive).
            - Addressed: The violation is not Resolved or Archived, and is addressed by one or more formal enforcement actions.
            - Unaddressed: The violation is not Resolved or Archived, and has not been addressed by formal enforcement.
