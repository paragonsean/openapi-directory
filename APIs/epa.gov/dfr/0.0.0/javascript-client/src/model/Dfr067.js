/**
 * U.S. EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) - Detailed Facility Report (DFR)
 * Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.  DFR Rest Services provide multiple service endpoints, to retrieve detailed facility location, enforcement, compliance monitoring, and pollutant information for any single facility.  See the Detailed Facility Report (DFR) Help Page (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/detailed-facility-report-help) for additional information on the DFR.  Additionally, a Data Dictionary (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/dfr-data-dictionary) is also available.  There is one primary service end point, get_dfr, that provides all available DFR data.  All other service end points that are exposed, will return data on a single section of the DFR.     \\ Additional ECHO Resources:   <a href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/web-services\">Web Services</a>, <a href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/resources/echo-data/about-the-data\">About ECHO's Data</a>, <a href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads\">Data Downloads</a>

For administrative Enforcement Actions, it is the penalty assessed in the Consent/Final Order.  It does not include the amount of the penalty mitigated due to a SEP or the amount shared with the state or local entities.  Interest payments associated with a penalty paid over time are not to be included in this amount.  It is the total Federal amount for each Final Order.

     * @param numberSettlements {String} The number of final orders issued under the enforcement action.
     * @param sepCost {String} The total value of all SEPs for all settlements at the enforcement case.
     * @param settlementDate {String} For federal judicial actions, this is the date the settlement document is signed by the presiding judge and entered by the Clerk of the Court. At that point, the settlement becomes a binding court order. For administrative actions, this is the date that the final order is signed and issued by the enforcement authority.
     * @param stateLocalPenalty {String} The total dollar penalty amount from all settlements to be paid to a state or local enforcement authority that is party to a concluded enforcement action.
     * @param statuteCode {String} Air Facility System (AFS) ID.
