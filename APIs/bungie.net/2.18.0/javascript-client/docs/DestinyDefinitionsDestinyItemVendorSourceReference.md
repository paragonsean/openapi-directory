## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**vendorHash** | **Number** | The identifier for the vendor that may sell this item. | [optional] 
**vendorItemIndexes** | **[Number]** | The Vendor sale item indexes that represent the sale information for this item. The same vendor may sell an item in multiple \&quot;ways\&quot;, hence why this is a list. (for instance, a weapon may be \&quot;sold\&quot; as a reward in a quest, for Glimmer, and for Masterwork Cores: each of those ways would be represented by a different vendor sale item with a different index) | [optional]
