## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**isSet** | **Boolean** | Whether the unlock flag is set. | [optional] 
**unlockHash** | **Number** | The hash identifier for the Unlock Flag. Use to lookup DestinyUnlockDefinition for static data. Not all unlocks have human readable data - in fact, most don&#39;t. But when they do, it can be very useful to show. Even if they don&#39;t have human readable data, you might be able to infer the meaning of an unlock flag with a bit of experimentation... | [optional]
