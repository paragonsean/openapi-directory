The list of indexes into the Talent Grid's \"nodes\" property for nodes in this exclusive set. (See DestinyTalentNodeDefinition.nodeIndex)

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**nodeIndexes** | **List&lt;Integer&gt;** | The list of node indexes for the exclusive set. Historically, these were indexes. I would have liked to replace this with nodeHashes for consistency, but it&#39;s way too late for that. (9:09 PM, he&#39;s right!) |  [optional] |
