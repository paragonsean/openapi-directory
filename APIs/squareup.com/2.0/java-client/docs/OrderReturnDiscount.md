# OrderReturnDiscount

Represents a discount being returned that applies to one or more return line items in an order.  Fixed-amount, order-scoped discounts are distributed across all non-zero return line item totals. The amount distributed to each return line item is relative to that itemâ€™s contribution to the order subtotal.
