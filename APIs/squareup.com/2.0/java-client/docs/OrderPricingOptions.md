# OrderPricingOptions

Pricing options for an order. The options affect how the order's price is calculated. They can be used, for example, to apply automatic price adjustments that are based on preconfigured [pricing rules](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogPricingRule).
