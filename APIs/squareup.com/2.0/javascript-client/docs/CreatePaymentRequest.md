# SquareConnectApi.CreatePaymentRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**acceptPartialAuthorization** | **Boolean** | If set to &#x60;true&#x60; and charging a Square Gift Card, a payment might be returned with &#x60;amount_money&#x60; equal to less than what was requested. For example, a request for $20 when charging a Square Gift Card with a balance of $5 results in an APPROVED payment of $5. You might choose to prompt the buyer for an additional payment to cover the remainder or cancel the Gift Card payment. This field cannot be &#x60;true&#x60; when &#x60;autocomplete &#x3D; true&#x60;.  For more information, see [Partial amount with Square Gift Cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments#partial-payment-gift-card).  Default: false | [optional] 
**amountMoney** | [**Money**](Money.md) |  | 
**appFeeMoney** | [**Money**](Money.md) |  | [optional] 
**autocomplete** | **Boolean** | If set to &#x60;true&#x60;, this payment will be completed when possible. If set to &#x60;false&#x60;, this payment is held in an approved state until either explicitly completed (captured) or canceled (voided). For more information, see [Delayed capture](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments/card-payments#delayed-capture-of-a-card-payment).  Default: true | [optional]

**customerId** | **String** | The [Customer](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/Customer) ID of the customer associated with the payment.  This is required if the &#x60;source_id&#x60; refers to a card on file created using the Customers API. | [optional] 
**delayDuration** | **String** | The duration of time after the payment&#39;s creation when Square automatically cancels the payment. This automatic cancellation applies only to payments that do not reach a terminal state (COMPLETED, CANCELED, or FAILED) before the &#x60;delay_duration&#x60; time period.  This parameter should be specified as a time duration, in RFC 3339 format, with a minimum value of 1 minute.  Note: This feature is only supported for card payments. This parameter can only be set for a delayed capture payment (&#x60;autocomplete&#x3D;false&#x60;).  Default:  - Card-present payments: \&quot;PT36H\&quot; (36 hours) from the creation time. - Card-not-present payments: \&quot;P7D\&quot; (7 days) from the creation time. | [optional]

**shippingAddress** | [**Address**](Address.md) |  | [optional] 
**sourceId** | **String** | The ID for the source of funds for this payment. This can be a payment token  (card nonce) generated by the Square payment form or a card on file made with the  Customers API.
