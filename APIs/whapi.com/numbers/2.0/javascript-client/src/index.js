/**
 * Numbers API
 * The William Hill Numbers API uses a single method that allows you to generate random numbers for your application. Numbers can either be unique or can be produced with the chance that some might be the same. For example, you can have a highest value of 6 and a lowest value of 1 with a count of 2 with a unique value of false - this will give you two numbers between 1 and 6 which are independent, just like two dice being rolled.<br /><br />The Numbers API is a Private API and therefore not automatically available to developers. To use this API, contact your business manager who will guide you through the separate Terms and Conditions of use before you can have the API assigned to your application.

* The <code>index</code> module provides access to constructors for all the classes which comprise the public API.
* <p>
* An AMD (recommended!) or CommonJS application will generally do something equivalent to the following:
* <pre>
* var NumbersApi = require('index'); // See note below*.
* var xxxSvc = new NumbersApi.XxxApi(); // Allocate the API class we're going to use.
* var yyyModel = new NumbersApi.Yyy(); // Construct a model instance.
* yyyModel.someProperty = 'someValue';
* ...
* var zzz = xxxSvc.doSomething(yyyModel); // Invoke the service.
* ...
* </pre>
* <em>*NOTE: For a top-level AMD script, use require(['index'], function(){...})
* and put the application logic within the callback function.</em>
* </p>
* <p>
* A non-AMD browser application (discouraged) might do something like this:
* <pre>
* var xxxSvc = new NumbersApi.XxxApi(); // Allocate the API class we're going to use.
* var yyy = new NumbersApi.Yyy(); // Construct a model instance.
* yyyModel.someProperty = 'someValue';
* ...
* var zzz = xxxSvc.doSomething(yyyModel); // Invoke the service.
* ...
* </pre>
