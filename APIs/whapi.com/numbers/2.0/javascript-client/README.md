# numbers_api

NumbersApi - JavaScript client for numbers_api
The William Hill Numbers API uses a single method that allows you to generate random numbers for your application. Numbers can either be unique or can be produced with the chance that some might be the same. For example, you can have a highest value of 6 and a lowest value of 1 with a count of 2 with a unique value of false - this will give you two numbers between 1 and 6 which are independent, just like two dice being rolled.<br /><br />The Numbers API is a Private API and therefore not automatically available to developers. To use this API, contact your business manager who will guide you through the separate Terms and Conditions of use before you can have the API assigned to your application.
This SDK is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install numbers_api --save
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your numbers_api from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### git

If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var NumbersApi = require('numbers_api');


var api = new NumbersApi.NumbersApi()
var apiKey = "apiKey_example"; // {String} A unique identifier of your application that is generated by the API portal and presented in the header.
var apiSecret = "apiSecret_example"; // {String} Another unique identifier for your application. The secret must never be sent over HTTP.
var gameCode = "gameCode_example"; // {String} Identifier that indicates the game for which the RNG (Random Number Generator) has been used.
var highest = 56; // {Number} Highest possible value to be returned.
var lowest = 56; // {Number} Lowest possible value to be returned.
var count = 56; // {Number} Number of values to be returned.
var unique = true; // {Boolean} Should the numbers returned be unique
var opts = {
  'apiTicket': "apiTicket_example" // {String} The authentication ticket associated with the user session. The getRandomNumbers method operates in two different ways – ‘Demo’ mode and ‘Live’ mode. In Demo mode, where no money is involved, the ticket is not required and can be used without it. In Live mode, when there is a financial outcome, the developer must supply a valid authentication and the ticket must be supplied. Important: The service should not be used in Live mode without a ticket.
};
var callback = function(error, data, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
};
api.getRandomNumbers(apiKey, apiSecret, gameCode, highest, lowest, count, unique, opts, callback);

```
