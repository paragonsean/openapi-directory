ShipEngine API

- API version: 1.1.202304191404
- Generator version: 7.9.0

ShipEngine's easy-to-use REST API lets you manage all of your shipping needs without worrying about the complexities of different carrier APIs and protocols. We handle all the heavy lifting so you can focus on providing a first-class shipping experience for your customers at the best possible prices.

Each of ShipEngine's features can be used by itself or in conjunction with each other to build powerful shipping functionality into your application or service.

## Getting Started
If you're new to REST APIs then be sure to read our [introduction to REST](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rest/) to understand the basics.  Learn how to [authenticate yourself to ShipEngine](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/), and then use our [sandbox environment](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/sandbox/) to kick the tires and get familiar with our API. If you run into any problems, then be sure to check the [error handling guide](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/errors/) for tips.

Here are some step-by-step **tutorials** to get you started:

  - [Learn how to create your first shipping label](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/)
  - [Calculate shipping costs and compare rates across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/)
  - [Track packages on-demand or in real time](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/)
  - [Validate mailing addresses anywhere on Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/)


## Shipping Labels for Every Major Carrier
ShipEngine makes it easy to [create shipping labels for any carrier](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/) and [download them](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/downloading/) in a [variety of file formats](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/formats/). You can even customize labels with your own [messages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/messages/) and [images](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/branding/).


## Real-Time Package Tracking
With ShipEngine you can [get the current status of a package](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/) or [subscribe to real-time tracking updates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/webhooks/) via webhooks. You can also create [custimized tracking pages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/branded-tracking-page/) with your own branding so your customers will always know where their package is.


## Compare Shipping Costs Across Carriers
Make sure you ship as cost-effectively as possible by [comparing rates across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/get-shipment-rates/) using the ShipEngine Rates API. Or if you don't know the full shipment details yet, then you can [get rate estimates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/estimate/) with limited address info.


## Worldwide Address Validation
ShipEngine supports [address validation](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/) for virtually [every country on Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/countries/), including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany, France, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and over 160 others.

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:

1. CMake 3.2+
2. Qt
3. C++ Compiler

## Getting Started

example.h:
```c++

#include <iostream>
#include "../client/OAIAccountApi.h"

using namespace test_namespace;

class Example : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT
    OAICreate_account_settings_image_request_body create();
public Q_SLOTS:
   void exampleFunction1();
};

```

example.cpp:
```c++

#include "../client/OAIAccountApi.h"
#include "example.h"
#include <QTimer>
#include <QEventLoop>

OAICreate_account_settings_image_request_body Example::create(){
    OAICreate_account_settings_image_request_body obj;
 return obj;
}

void Example::exampleFunction1(){
     OAIAccountApi apiInstance;
     
      // Configure API key authorization: api_key
      apiInstance.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY NAME","YOUR API KEY");

      QEventLoop loop;
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIAccountApi::createAccountImageSignal, [&]() {
          loop.quit();
      });
      connect(&apiInstance, &OAIAccountApi::createAccountImageSignalE, [&](QNetworkReply::NetworkError, QString error_str) {
          qDebug() << "Error happened while issuing request : " << error_str;
          loop.quit();
      });

      OAICreate_account_settings_image_request_body oai_create_account_settings_image_request_body = create(); // OAICreate_account_settings_image_request_body | 
      apiInstance.createAccountImage(oai_create_account_settings_image_request_body);
      QTimer::singleShot(5000, &loop, &QEventLoop::quit);
      loop.exec();
  }

```

## Documentation for Servers

Parameterized Servers are supported. Define a server in the API for each endpoint with arbitrary numbers of variables:

```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:{port}/{basePath}
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
    port:
      enum:
        - '3000'
        - '1000'
      default: '3000'
    basePath:
      default: v1
```
To change the default variable, use this function in each Api:
```c++
int setDefaultServerValue(int serverIndex,const QString &operation, const QString &variable,const QString &val);
```
The parameter "serverIndex" will choose a server from the server list for each endpoint. There is always at least one server with index 0. The Parameter "operation" should be the desired endpoint operationid.
Variable is the name of the variable you wish to change and the value is the new default Value.
The function will return -1 when the variable does not exists, -2 if value is not defined in the variable enum and -3 if the operation is not found.

If your endpoint has multiple server objects in the servers array, you can set the server that will be used with this function:
```c++
void setServerIndex(const QString &operation, int serverIndex);
```
Parameter "operation" should be your operationid. "serverIndex" is the index you want to set as your default server. The function will check if there is a server with your index.
Here is an example of multiple servers in the servers array. The first server will have index 0 and the second will have index 1.
```yaml
servers:
- url: http://{server}:8080/
  description: Description of the Server
  variables:
    server:
        enum:
          - 'petstore'
          - 'qa-petstore'
          - 'dev-petstore'
        default: 'petstore'
- url: https://localhost:8080/v1
```
