## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**inlineKeyboard** | **List&lt;List&lt;InlineKeyboardButton&gt;&gt;** | Array of button rows, each represented by an Array of [InlineKeyboardButton](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#inlinekeyboardbutton) objects |  |
|**keyboard** | **List&lt;List&lt;KeyboardButton&gt;&gt;** | Array of button rows, each represented by an Array of [KeyboardButton](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#keyboardbutton) objects |  |
|**oneTimeKeyboard** | **Boolean** | *Optional*. Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as it&#39;s been used. The keyboard will still be available, but clients will automatically display the usual letter-keyboard in the chat â€“ the user can press a special button in the input field to see the custom keyboard again. Defaults to *false*. |  [optional] |
|**resizeKeyboard** | **Boolean** | *Optional*. Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically for optimal fit (e.g., make the keyboard smaller if there are just two rows of buttons). Defaults to *false*, in which case the custom keyboard is always of the same height as the app&#39;s standard keyboard. |  [optional] |
|**selective** | **Boolean** | *Optional*. Use this parameter if you want to force reply from specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the *text* of the [Message](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#message) object; 2) if the bot&#39;s message is a reply (has *reply\\_to\\_message\\_id*), sender of the original message. |  [optional] |
|**removeKeyboard** | **Boolean** | Requests clients to remove the custom keyboard (user will not be able to summon this keyboard; if you want to hide the keyboard from sight but keep it accessible, use *one\\_time\\_keyboard* in [ReplyKeyboardMarkup](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#replykeyboardmarkup)) |  |
|**forceReply** | **Boolean** | Shows reply interface to the user, as if they manually selected the bot&#39;s message and tapped &#39;Reply&#39; |  |
