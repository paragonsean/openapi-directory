GlobalWineScoreApiDocumentation - JavaScript client for global_wine_score_api_documentation


The GlobalWineScore API is designed as a RESTful API, providing several resources and methods depending on your usage plan.

For further information please refer to <a href=\"https://www.globalwinescore.com/plans\" target=\"_blank\">our plans</a>.

# Authentication
The API uses token-based authentication.
In order to authenticate your requests, you need to include a specific header in each of your requests:

```
Authorization: Token {YOUR-API-TOKEN}
```
The word <b>Token</b> must be written. Your requests must also use the <b>HTTPS</b> protocol.

If you don't have a token yet, you need to apply for one [here](https://www.globalwinescore.com/api/).

Your personal token can be found under the <a href=\"https://www.globalwinescore.com/account/api/\" target=\"_blank\">My account > API</a> section of the GlobalWineScore website

# Format
The API provides several rendering formats which you can control using the `Accept` header or `format` query parameter.

- JSON (default): no header or `Accept: application/json`
- XML: `Accept: application/xml`
# Rate limiting
For API requests, the rate limit allows for up to 10 requests per minute.

# Error handling

Whether a request succeeded is indicated by the HTTP status code. A 2xx status code indicates success, whereas a 4xx status code indicates failure.

When a request fails, the response body is still JSON, but always contains a `detail` field with a description of the error, which you can inspect for debugging.

For example, trying to access the API without proper authentication will return code 403 along with the message:

`{\"detail\": \"Authentication credentials were not provided.\"}`

# Ordering

At the moment, GlobalWineScores may be sorted by `date` and `score`. Use \"-\"
to sort in descending order.

# Continuous synchronization

If you need to synchronize your database with our API, you can query our API using `?ordering=-date` to get the newest scores first, which means you won't have to crawl the whole catalog every time :-)

# Quick search interface
If you need to search our catalog (e.g. to align it with yours), we're providing you with a handy interface accessible here: <a href=\"https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/</a>

You need to be logged in (email/password) to access this page, but other than that you can share it with anyone in your team and start searching right away !

## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install global_wine_score_api_documentation --save
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your global_wine_score_api_documentation from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### git

If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var GlobalWineScoreApiDocumentation = require('global_wine_score_api_documentation');

var defaultClient = GlobalWineScoreApiDocumentation.ApiClient.instance;
// Configure API key authorization: TokenAuthentication
var TokenAuthentication = defaultClient.authentications['TokenAuthentication'];
TokenAuthentication.apiKey = "YOUR API KEY"
// Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
//TokenAuthentication.apiKeyPrefix['Authorization'] = "Token"

var api = new GlobalWineScoreApiDocumentation.GlobalWineScoreApi()
var opts = {
  'authorization': "Token <YOUR-API-TOKEN>", // {String} 
  'wineId': [null], // {[Number]} The exact `id` of the wine. Can be used multiple times (e.g `?wine_id=114959&wine_id=114952`) <br/> If you need to find the `wine_id` for your wines, use our <a href=\"https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/\" target=\"_blank\">search page</a> 
  'vintage': "2000", // {String} The vintage you want to search against.
  'color': "color_example", // {String} The lowercase color of the wine.
  'isPrimeurs': false, // {Boolean} Only show the <a href=\"See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_primeur\">en primeur</a> GlobalWineScores 
  'lwin': "1014033", // {String} L-WIN wine identifier (See definition <a href=\"https://www.liv-ex.com/lwin/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) 
  'lwin11': "10140332000", // {String} L-WIN wine/vintage identifier (See definition <a href=\"https://www.liv-ex.com/lwin/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) 
  'limit': 100, // {Number} Number of results to return per page.
  'offset': 100, // {Number} The initial index from which to return the results.
  'ordering': "'-date'" // {String} Which field to use when ordering the results.
};
var callback = function(error, data, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully.');
  }
};
api.globalwinescoresLatestGet(opts, callback);

```
