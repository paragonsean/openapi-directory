/*
 * Fire Financial Services Business API
 * The fire.com API allows you to deeply integrate Business Account features into your application or back-office systems.  The API provides read access to your profile, accounts and transactions, event-driven notifications of activity on the account and payment initiation via batches. Each feature has its own HTTP endpoint and every endpoint has its own permission.   The API exposes 3 main areas of functionality: financial functions, service information and service configuration. ## Financial Functions These functions provide access to your account details, transactions, payee accounts, payment initiation etc. ## Service Functions These provide information about the fees and limits applied to your account. ## Service configuration These provide information about your service configs - applications, webhooks, API tokens, etc.
