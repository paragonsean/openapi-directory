/**
 * DVP Data API
 * The Docker DVP Data API allows [Docker Verified Publishers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/publish/) to view image pull analytics data for their namespaces. Analytics data can be retrieved as raw data, or in a summary format.    #### Summary data  In your summary data CSV, you will have access to the data points listed below. You can request summary data for a complete week (Monday through Sunday) or for a complete month (available on the first day of the following month).   There are two levels of summary data:  - Repository-level, a summary of every namespace and repository - Tag- or digest-level, a summary of every namespace, repository, and reference   (tag or digest)   The summary data formats contain the following data points:  - Unique IP address count - Pulls by tag count - Pulls by digest count - Version check count  #### Raw data  In your raw data CSV you will have access to the data points listed below. You can request raw data for a complete week (Monday through Sunday) or for a complete month (available on the first day of the following month). **Note:** each action is represented as a single row.  - Type (industry) - Host (cloud provider) - Country (geolocation) - Timestamp - Namespace - Repository - Reference (digest is always included, tag is provided when available) - HTTP request method - Action, one of the following:   - Pull by tag   - Pull by digest   - Version check - User-Agent
